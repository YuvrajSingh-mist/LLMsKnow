"This was way more a clear cut decision that the final of 1966. In that case, I can see how it was a hard thing to judge.",
I am German and for the love of the game: This was a f....ng joke that this goal was disallowed. On the other hand: Revenge for our stolen title in 1966 tastes best served cold 🙂,

It makes me laugh that Germany are now up in arms about a “stonewall” penalty not being awarded to them v Spain in Euro’24. The word for this is karma. You can’t always have things all your own way.,Favor
Neuer would have seen that that was well over the line as well. So far over the line.,Against
Karma today. Handfoul of spain did not count. No penalty,Against
You don’t even need goal line technology to see that’s a goal. The only technology needed was the camera which the referee could’ve easily rewinded back. At the end of the day it was a Goal and should count towards Frank Lampard’s goals with England.,Favor

The English referees in a club match robbed Lampard once when he thrashed a shot into the top left hand corner of the net only for it to bounce back out of the goal. No goal given. Great champion and team robbed again here.,

"Stop comparing this to Hurst's goal in 1966. In that case, the ball most likely did fall on the line and wasn't a goal. But it's impossible to say for certain with the footage we have. It was a tight call for the linesman. It is the kind of call they routinely made mistakes on in the days before slow mo replays. This just happened to be in such a high profile game. I wouldn't blame England or even the referees for this. There were also no Jumbotrons in the stadium in 1966 replaying it._x000D_",

The referee is legitimately retarded,
