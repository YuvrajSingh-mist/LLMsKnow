"This was way more a clear cut decision that the final of 1966. In that case, I can see how it was a hard thing to judge.

This goal from Lampard in 2010 was not at all hard. It's just a normal fotball goal rhat was never allowed",Against
"I am German and for the love of the game: This was a f....ng joke that this goal was disallowed. On the other hand: Revenge for our stolen title in 1966 tastes best served cold 🙂 

But again: One of the biggest mistakes in soccer history.

On a funny note: Why is it always England being involved in World Cup's biggest mistakes

1966 - Wembley Goal (England - Germany)

Karma today. Handfoul of spain did not count. No penalty,Against
You don’t even need goal line technology to see that’s a goal. The only technology needed was the camera which the referee could’ve easily rewinded back. At the end of the day it was a Goal and should count towards Frank Lampard’s goals with England.,Favor

The English referees in a club match robbed Lampard once when he thrashed a shot into the top left hand corner of the net only for it to bounce back out of the goal. No goal given. Great champion and team robbed again here.,
"Well 1966 the goal was given because the assist referee was influenced by Hurst's reaction as he later admitted (it doesn't matter if the ball crossed the line or not), the swiss referee had not seen a goal and asked the assist.

Here is a similar situation, Neuer pretended that nothing happened and brought the ball very quick back into the game. The refs were influenced by this.

Reactions mattered in both games. The worst part is that in both cases the refs were absolutely useless. At least we have today technology and video proof to prevent situations like that as good as possible. But it boggles my mind that they still make mistakes despite having four referes on the field and 3 individuals that review the tv footage.",Against

"Stop comparing this to Hurst's goal in 1966. In that case, the ball most likely did fall on the line and wasn't a goal. But it's impossible to say for certain with the footage we have. It was a tight call for the linesman. It is the kind of call they routinely made mistakes on in the days before slow mo replays. This just happened to be in such a high profile game. I wouldn't blame England or even the referees for this. There were also no Jumbotrons in the stadium in 1966 replaying it._x000D_

Unlike Hurst's goal, the debate over Lampard's goal was settled in less than a minute after just one replay. And the fact that there was no goal line technology even as late as 2010 when several other sports had video assisted technology is just ridiculous. So it was a true injustice.",Against

"It was a perfectly good goal but let's be realistic, Germany could've been at least 4 goals ahead by half-time. The scoreline of 2-1 flattered England a lot.

Yes, I know it should've been 2-2 but that's no excuse as to why England lost. England lost because they were a bunch of overpaid bigheads who did nothing other than completely mock the game.....and those performances followed on during Poland/Ukraine 2012, Brazil 2014 & France 2016. Germany played phenomenal attacking football throughout this tournament and had they not been so frightened of Spain in the semis, they could've won this tournament. They've been playing good football since the tournament they hosted in 2006. I know they won Brazil 2014 but they could (and should) have won at least another tournament for the last 10 years.

Anyway, England supposedly scored a ""goal"" in the 1966 Final when it was proven that the ball never actually crossed the line. You never heard the Germans using that as an excuse. They were gracious in defeat & accepted it. Need to stop giving excuses and accept that the England players are arrogant lowlife shits. Russia 2018 will be diabolical as well!",

The spin on it makes it impossible for the ball to bounce the way the ref thought it did.",
Revenge completed for 1966,Favor
"Would it really have altered the course of the game? It might have been less one sided but Germany would have still won. I support England but, with all their football disappointmets, learnt years ago not to get too emotional.

We forget, England were poor in that tournament. Against the USA (who were medicore back then) it was an unconvincing performance. They were abysmal against Algeria(worst performance ever) then werr underpar in their win against Slovenia. They were meant to be one of the favourites and were in a piss easy group which they should have easily won.

Then they got thrased by Germany.",Against

If I had it my way I’d get rid of the last thing I hate about football which is time wasting by introducing some tule change where the clock will stop when the ball isn’t in play (we’d have to reduce the halves to at least 30 effective minutes which is about how much is actually played in a 45 min half). It’d make the ending of games that much more fair by removing the recourse of time wasting by the winning team and make it all more exciting. 

At the very least it should be introduced during stoppage time. When a referee says 2 min added they should play 2 min precisely with time stopping when ball isn’t in play.",Favor

Something like 3000 Germans, myself in the middle of the lot, pretty much front section. As far as I could tell the only English in the crowd, going by England flags, scarfs and shirts one could see. Confirmed by some folks I knew who came late and were viewing from the rear. Was fun up till then, had to take some comments, jokes etc. But all in a good manner. Next to me was tall German holding his beer all the time. When Lampard scored everybody just went either silent, groaned, moaned, swore etc. I was cheering. Which then turned into utter disbelief by all present. After it became clear the ref team were a load of incompetent baffons, the tall German next to me said he was sorry, hugged me with one arm and offered me his beer. All was good. PS: I hate beer, but out of courtesy I took a few nips. So that was to me a ""bitter"" experience in the end. Either way. 😅",Favor

FIFA is more corrupt than US and Russia combined what do you expect,Against
"VAR is a fundamentally misconceived attempt by Americanized zombies to ""fix"" what was already the worlds most popular sport. There is a reason why as regards football, after asking ""who won the game?""; you then ask ""who DESERVED to win the game?"". Because football is unfair, its always been unfair; it has never ""worked"" as a sport. Its a game where scoring once from a random deflection pretty much guarantees you cant lose fer chrissakes. It is cruel and unjust and it is the only sport where being significantly better than the opposition is not enough to win. Which makes it a test of character - the real greats can overcome the random calamities and impose their will on a game where the stakes are critical from the very first second and no amount of ability ensures success. 

And, as it happens, when you get down to the real serious stuff -- the late stages of world cups -- the """"injustices"" invariably act to favour the better, more complete side. If you are English, you would perhaps like this incident, and the hand of god, changed? Well, remember, you also lose ""they think it's all over!"" if you do. You gonna take that deal? Of course not. The right team won in '66, in '86 and in '10 -- and not only would VAR have perhaps led to unfortunate results for football as a whole -- but all the iconic incidents of history are ERASED. 

If VAR does not lead to the end of injustice in football, then it is pointless --  its only contribution to suck all the intensity out of the unique explosion of emotion from important goals while we all settle down to wait for the ""decision""


If VAR does lead to the end of injustice in football, then it will eventually kill the sport, by reducing it to the status of other ""normal"" sports....and eventually revealing that the sport never worked like a conventional sport in the first place and that was the whole fucking reason it took over the world.


But you dumb cunts are cheering all the way, because you follow the ""opinion""s of pundits and presenters who are obliged to react positively to ""progress"" (ie Americanization"") or their Jew masters wont give them anymore shekels.",

I watched England vs Croatia today (i’m English) and I have to say Croatia were persistent, BUT the ref was blatant in allowing the game to continue when the ball went completely off, and ignored plenty of fouls.

If this goal was allowed which it should have been. I think it would have made a difference. How in the name of God was this goal disallowed? It was way over the line. Germany still beat us 4-1 though as they were the better team. England played awful the second half.,Against
We were cheated!,Against
Just pay Sepp Blatter 20 Million Euros so he will agree for an Eagle Eye Technology. The guy needs some money you know.,

GERMAN mashine did work well :))) One goal couldn't help. English team is to old :) Future is in Germans hands :) :P,Favor
what a brilliant goal ,Favor
@marklp1 Because it would have made the half time score 2-2 and that would have made the players more positive leading into the second half. They came out playing better at the start of the second with Lampard almost scoring a free kick. Had the goal been given and Lampards free kick gone in then we would have been in the lead. Germany did play better and might save still have gone on to win but i think it would have made the rest of the game more competative. There was no way back at 3-1.,Against
@marklp1 False offside does not apply in the kick:) New to the German goalkeeper has made the discount. Germany deserved to win. OLE OLE OLE SUPER GERMANY OLELELELE,Favor
Bum raped by Germany's under 21s. You lot are just like my Scotland in 1978 boasting that you would do this that and the other. Take a tip:- stop the arrogance then Wales Scotland and Ireland just might lend you our support.,
you cannot be offside from a goal kick therefore klose was not offside. Upson and Terry were just shit unfortunately. ,Against
"@marklp1 mate if the game was at 2-2, as it would've been, the whole mentality would've been different, disallowing the goal must have destroyed the confidence of many players",Against
"England had goal disallowed which was the best of one tournament by. Hmm...perhaps it may have had a psychological effect on the players, so the ref did an Ur's Meier's [Swiss ref that disallowed Sol Cambells Goal in Euro 2004]. SERIOUSLY Eng were abysmal, and Wayne Rooney looked obese & unfit he can score for ManU bt not for Eng?! Eng played like division one nt World cup quality.

as the ball hits the back of the side netting the netting is loose ...and as it hits with nowhere to go the netting bulges outwards and pulls against the ball forcing it through the hole which has to expand as the ball hits and the net pushes towards the ball ....this increases the speed....( its forced through ),Against

Everybody cheered but the referee whistle remained silent. People started talking and shouting that was a goal. The stadium had recently been renovated with one side getting glass walled VIP lounge rooms with huge television screens. The game was live transmitted and the other three sides of the stadium could look up at the screens and see the slow mow video of the ball in the goal but bouncing back from the steel post. 
Got hilarious when the spectators began singing to the referee to look at the TV monitors, but the goal was never given.

"It changed football, and now the sport is much worse for it. All this technology for ""fairness"" is ruining the game. Euro 2024 was a complete horror show with all the goals that were called back over the most marginal of offsides. Literally the tiniest portion of someone's toe being ahead of the defender gets an otherwise solid goal getting called back over and over again made the whole thing a farce.

In the 1966 WC final England was awarded a goal in the final against (West) Germany that had not clearly crossed the line, and should not have counted, and England went on to win it. So they ought to have accepted the event in 2010 and moved on. But this most prima donna of footballing nations can't seem to do that.",

Was at a family BBQ when 2-0 down we sort of accepted that we was going out. We knew we had a bad world cup so going out was probably right. So decided to just try and have a good drink and a good time. Then when Upson scored we got excited again. And when Lampard scored we got in a massive huddle bouncing around the garden. Then my wife who was pregnant so sitting said it's not a goal. We thought she was joking. Then when we saw it our hearts sank. Only watching England can be that cruel. You get to a stage where you accept the result. Only to have something give you that belief just to have it be snatched away again lol.,Against

The most shocking moment is Luis Suarez's handball against Ghana. If Suarez doesn't save that ball with his hands, the balls goes in and Ghana make history by being the first African country to make it to a WC semi final. 

So no. It's not the most shocking because the result remains unknown if Lampards goal stands, whereas if Ghana's goal stand, Uruguay go home, and Ghana are through to the next round.",Against

"They forgot to mention arguably the most shocking and scariest part of this moment (which I understand, because there was *a lot* to be shocked about, but still)...

That in 2006, in an Adidas commercial, an incident *eerily similar* to this was portrayed (1:53-2:00 in the video below)! In that commercial, *Lampard* shoots the ball towards the crossbar as *German* goalkeeper Oliver Kahn reaches out with one outstretched arm, the ball hits the crossbar and comes down near the line as Kahn grabs it, and Lampard and his team start celebrating a goal while Kahn denies it and there's controversy over whether the ball crossed the line! The commercial even showed Gerrard and Schweinsteiger (both of whom were on the field playing when that ghost goal happened in 2010) being the primary field players standing next to Kahn arguing about it! And yes, obviously, at the time, that was supposed to be a reference towards the 1966 controversy, but the fact that that ""modern-day reenactment"" of that controversy *actually happened* with the *exact* same England player taking the controversial shot four years later and spotlighting two more *actual* participants in the real-life event 4 years later is *downright chilling!*

This was BY FAR the most shocking moment, and it's just sheer, sheer arrogance to believe that England feeling hard done by when they lost 4-1, to assume that that one Lampard goal would have made that much of a difference, is a bigger, more shocking moment.

Funny to see that Europe lives in peace when people talking about wars and rivaleries because of the war. In my opinion Football shouldn't be about war or politics. 66 wasn't a goal like this was one but come on nobody can prove that germany would have won in 66' when the refs called it right like nobody could have predicted that England would have won this Time. Calm down and chill Germans know what the their former country did in the 30's and 40's. But what should Germans do they Take the most Immigrants who came from Africa to help them. People from today shouldn't judged for that. And If you look that Way at a football Match than just learn History about every opponent to criticizes their history and don't Watch the game.,Against

Why complain? Check back with 1966. The English deserved that.,Against

"When US's goal was disallowed, which definitely would've won them the game, that teenager still living in his mum's basement started making fun of the US, and it was placed at #26.

Where England won the world cup from "" a goal "" which the ball didn't even pass the line. "" Wembley Goal "" as widely known by the world. Englishmen are such butthurt and jealous people because they know they will never be like Germany. Only a single star and the creators of Football goes out since at the group stage. -.- 

But hey ! Even if the Lampard's goal would be valid. Germany would have won anyway "" 4-2 "". because Germany dominated the whole game and of course they are much superior than England. And mentioning "" Wars "" or "" Nazis "" in a football game, I must call this a retarded and a stupid act made by losers. 
At least, England. Thank you to Germany for beating Argentina. For the Falklands. ",
"This disallowed goal to me was karma at its finest.  England were poking fun at the Americans for their disallowed goal against Slovenia that would've won them the game.  This is what they got for it in the long run.  It's a shame that it was at Frank Lampard's expense and not Wayne Rooney's.

It still should've counted though.",Favor

The chance that Germany would have won if the wembley goal hasn't counted is much higher than the chance that England would have won this match. They lost because Germany had the better team, not because that goal didn't count. And even if they conceded two goals in the second half because their moral was down then they don't have what it takes to win a world cup anyway.",Against
You know terry was going on the offence and england was playing too far forward becoz of dat goal,Against

"One of the biggest rivalry's? Not sure about that...I mean, playing against England is always a classic, but the team is not only in the top three for the Germans.

The fact of the matter is, that probably wouldnt have happened, but it might have.

"How many English Chelsea fans tried to justify the ghost goal Martin Atkinson gave them in the FAcup semi-final 2012 against Spurs? which was a worse decision than this by the way. Also a false result (5-1 to Chelsea) they claimed they would've still won 4-1 without the ghost goal which everyone including themselves know is bullshit because it had been a tight game and it all changed in the 2nd half. Chelsea scored 3 goals AFTER the ghost goal and also they had only scored 1 valid goal before they should've had their goalkeeper sent off (so it's wrong for them to even say they would've certainly won fullstop without these decisions).
But just because they finished the match with 4 valid goals to Tottenham's 1, they thought that made the disgraceful decision at only 1-0 absolutely fine YET these same fans were claiming if this Lampard goal vs Germany wasn't disallowed then things could've been different and England could've won, despite their logic would mean Germany still win the match 4-2 so why were they complaining??

They need to adopt coach's challenges and be able to change their decision making. Why they are not allowed to do that is just beyond me. How this goal was not given- I do not know. The excuse that all these countries cannot afford specific technology is not only bullshit, but appallingly condescending, shitheaded bullshit that is made up by someone who doesn't understand the game of football.

Does it really surprise anyone; FIFA is the most out of date sports organization in the world (probably doesn't help that it's also the most corrupt).

If that had been scored, we'd have gone in 2-2. Level, just needing to hold our own, with the momentum and feeling confident. There's just no way you can pretend we'd be playing with 9 men in the final third in that situation.

"Agreed. Actually, I don't think Neuer knew - he didn't even know where the ball was until it hit him on the back! Roy Carroll's, for Man United against Tottenham in 2004/5, that was much worse. Knew it was over the line, pretended it wasn't.

You're right about fair play though - Arshavin did a similar thing to Fowler, against Pompey for Arsenal in 2009.",Favor
Football is the war!!!!!,Against
"Well, England can shut up with their complaining since the same thing happened to Ukraine...",Against
"Actually I'm from the United States. When most keepers get scored on they acknowledge that a goal was scored on them. The only reason I can see the keeper here not doing is so is because A. he knew he was cheating the English of the goal or B. he didn't see it go in, and only saw its second bounce off the cross bar, and didn't think it went in.",Against

would have been such a good goal as well,Neutral

Fucking in mate england could of won it anyway guess its payback from 1966 see you in brazil guys,
"They were still only a goal down and Lampards shot could've given them the belief that they could score again. I think that Germany team weren't going to lose that game no matter what... It would be interesting to have seen what would've happened, but England aren't a strong side anymore.",Against
"we would have gone into the next half with our heads up, then the adrenalin would kick in, you'd be amazed. As much as it could have made no difference on the game, it had the exact opposite effect that it coud have changed the game.",Against
"As unfair as it was, lets be honest, would any keeper in the world have told the ref ""yes he scored on me"" if their chance at advancing in the World Cup was at stake?",Against
"Robbed my arse... Germany crushed England in that game, the disallowed goal is a weak excuse. Yes it was a goal, but there's no guarantee it would've changed that game at all. Especially when it finished the way it did.",Against
"Very true, we were robbed. The moment changed after the our first goal and if that had been allowed, which it clearly should have been, then i think the momentum from that would have pushed u to win. however, due to it not being allowed, it knocked the fight our of England  ",Against
This is what karma is called England for 1966,Against
what war? Didn't the US win the war? ><,Against
You are the only German i like.,Against
Only this would happen in a England Germany World Cup game.,Against
Makes up for 1966 mistake.,Favor
no im sorry germans dont know what nerves are they would of kept playing their football and won,Against
Never put David James in goal that was our fault,Against

You lost 4-1. Even if that counted you still would've lost so stop acting like England would have won the World Cup of that went in,Against
"I remember watching this, I was so pumped when we made it 2-1 because I knew we would fight for the next goal. I celebrated the second goal as soon as I saw it go over the line and then realised that it had not counted. I still think the second half would have been so different had that goal counted. ",Favor

"Obviously, you don't understand the football. Maybe you are Barca fan, who knows.",Against
"Of course the 'goal' would have changed the game. England would have had the momentum instead of the feeling of injustice.

But, to be honest David James had a complete shocker, which hardly helped matters.",Against
"No, justice was served for that with incidence like Ronald Koeman in 1993having done a sending off offence and then staying on the pitch to put the Dutch in the lead.

Furthermore, England had Maradona in 1986 putting Argentina was handballed goal eventually winning marginally 2.1 because of it.

More than this, Sol Campbell's chalked off goal against Argentina in 1998 seemed legitimate enough, plus Sol Campbell against against Portugal in Euro 2004. England ALWAYS get bad referees!

Wake up boy",Against
It's not your fault Lampard,Against
"Well, the England defence s u c k e  d anyway, so the only probable ttactics to win the match after 2-2 for englanders was to put all eleven men in their own penalty area and hope to draw the match to penalty shootout. All I'm saying that England was really bad that day and it's hypocritical to say that England would have win that match/",
"3 years after this has happened and I still think what utter bullshit, I wanted to cry when I saw that it was disallowed 3 years ago :')",Against
This world cup sucked because of the ref mistakes,Against
eyy dude me a favour and shut the fuck up bitch the ref is and idiot the man should be fired ,
"The butterfly effect is where one change so little, even one out of place molecule leads to lots of other events and eventually leads to a massive change. The reason why your train thing is not the butterfly effect is because it's just one obvious change of outcome. In the football match, 1 disallowed goal leads to the team playing differently. So basically, if the goal was allowed, England might have played better and won. Hope I'm explaining it properly :) ",Against
The quote near the end shows just 1 of many many examples of why Sepp Blatter is a total and utter pillock. Why give the decision to someone else? Ask Tennis players Sepp. So the RIGHT decision is made. He's basically saying - f**k whether the decision is right or not as long as people can debate it. Sorry Sepp but that's an absolute load of bollocks when it comes to giving a reason to avoid goal line technology in any competition particularly 4-years-apart Internationals!!,Against
"""In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, in which a small change at one place in a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.""

What are you on about? If this goal went in then it could have spurred England on to win the game or at least attempt to hold for a draw. You're not honestly saying that the game would have panned out EXACTLY the same if this goal had counted?,Against
"yes because the population of an entire country is responsible for one referees decision, who was from uruguay.",Against

AR really should have been able to see that.  Nothing in the way.,Favor
Still gets me mad this,Against
"absolutely right. it is a goal. Point is the ref isn't trying to the England national team over. You need to keep playing even when the ref isn't helping.  it's hard I know, Ref's make bad calls a lot. the best thing to do in my opinion is put a 4th and 5th ref behind the goal for a better view.",Favor
That goal could change the game dramatically,Favor
Still not as bad as Frings handball in 2002 quarters v USA,Against
revenge for 1966^^,Against
Germany had no fault it was the decison of the refery and he sucked,Against
Lampard best in the world,Against
"problem is, England's team and their fans started looking at this for the reason they lost LONG BEFORE THE GAME WAS OVER!!! you need to keep playing. if the ref makes a mistake their's not much he or anyone can do about it. He has to call it as he sees it. He can't listen to players or fans. once he makes the call, it stands...I know it sucks when he makes a terrible one, but just because you have an excuse, doesn't mean you get to say you lost because of injustice.",Against
"it clearly was a goal....In my opinion, they should put ref's behind the back post of the goals. it may not be perfect but i could help get the call right in situations like these. This has happend more than once......",Favor
Lampard suck so does england,Against
far from it they had nothing to do with the decision,Against

Yes the only reason we drew against the USA was because of a goalkeeper mistake - Rob Green is know for some howlers! Look that goal would've got us back into the game - you don't know how it would've ended up!,Against

"No it was not sheer luck. The 66' team was one of the best ever England squad. Banks best keeper in the world at the time, Moore best defender in the world at the time, Bobby Charlton one the best midfielders in the world at the time.

Yes but that is just your own little conspiracy theory.,Against

It's football...you never know.,Neutral
It matters because we could've still progressed in the tournament. It matters because going through beating a team like Germany would've given us momentum for the next round.,Favor

It would be disgraceful to his OWn country.

"In the 1960s if the ball looked like it was over the line, which in this case it does at 0:07 then it would be a goal. The idea that the ball has to be 100% over the line is mainly now due to the existence goal-line technology and VAR. Also the blurry nature of 1960s video footage might've made the ball and line look bigger, and so making it it look like they are closer than they actually are.

Hard to say from that angle. A shot that was perpendicular to the goal would give more proof either way. Oddest thing about this sequence was how Roger Hunt peeled away in celebration when he could have made a run on the ball and put it in the net himself to remove any doubt.,Neutral

thats probably why lampards got disallowed against germany,Against
"It looks like it could have crossed the line about two-thirds of the way up on it's trajectory down; it kind of curls in and then back out.

"This World Cup was clearly ""bought"" by the English... Starting off with the semi finals, against Portugal. England knew Portugal would beat them, so 1 day before the match they changed it from Liverpool to London, and made the Portuguese team travel in a second class cramped train... The Portuguese team showed clear signs of fatigue, and the way Nobby Stiles was marking Eusebio was just awful... In today's game Stiles would have been sent off and probably banned for more than 3 games... And i watched a documentary on Eusebio, and the portuguese players from 66 said that if the match was played in liverpool, they are sure that they would've won the game, and i really think the same.  England cries too much... I live in England and people here think England is some kind of amazing national team... They are mediocre. In 2004 against Portugal, Sol Campbell's goal was disallowed, the referee was 100% right. Ricardo was pushed down in his box. Lets face it... England's squad cannot compete with Brazil, Portugal, Spain",Against

We actually have a manager who has tried to mould a team together and it works.  However, Germany is able to do this repetitively with seemingly much less effort.

Nevertheless, I recognize this match as German's victory. Because DFB takes initiative for discovering talentful youg player such as Thomas Müller, Mesut Özil etc.

In terms of domestic league popularity between Premier league and Bundesliga, indeed global scale competitive club doesn't exist except Bayern in Bundesliga. 

However, in order to foster future's rising star, Bundesliga is ideal league for
domestic young player more than Premier league.

Any of those tournaments they had the players to go all the way but never the team. A lot of people say England went backwards after Euro 2000 but you look at the 2006 team and the only way they could lose would be the lottery of penalties. 2006 was England's peak in my opinion.",Favor
"After the humiliating 7-1 win over Brazil, it would have been very harsh on Germany if they'd lost the final against Argentina. They play a faster and more aggressive brand of 'tiki-taka' football and although they were at times, unconvincing in earlier matches, especially in the group stages, they saved their best until last. German football is on a different planet in terms of development of coaches, training facilities, producing world class talent etc. so I wouldn't be surprised if they won the Euros or the next World Cup, they're that good and could take some stopping. If England are ever going to have a hope in hell at a major tournament, they need to ship out all the foreign players. Full stop.﻿",

"Kiessling cheated, he knew it didn't go in, he put his hands on his head a universal sign players do when they missed a chance, he didn't tell the ref though, he chose to profit from it  instead, other players have owned up in similar situations before with an example being Miroslav Klose when  he played for Lazio he handled the ball into the goal, the ref did not see it, gave a goal initially but he told the ref what he did and the ref disallowed it.",

"Some of the decisions were either intentionally criminal and corrupt or absolute incompetence. Also, Don't forget the disallowed goal scored by Francesco Totti against South Korea in the 2002 World Cup which was incredibly just insane. Another one in which you knew the referee was incompetent, corrupt, and a coward was Leeds United's Peter Lorimer's screamer against Bayen Munchen in the 1975 European Cup Final. That one would have definitely changed the game, instead, the Leeds were deflated and Bayern scored 2 goals and won the game.",Against

"""Stealing"" the ball from the goalkeeper just is not allowed as it is way to dangerous.

Well they removed the 2nd not to have idols, changed the 4th the sabbath day Saturday the last day of the week to Sunday the first. God commands all not to buy or sell on Saturday. And in keeping the law u receive the seal of God. Then they split the 10th to make it appear there is still 10. How can u repent and be born again if u don't even know what sin is then? This is the greatest deception! He even calls himself the title of God alone The Holy Father. Everyone needs to read exodus 20 for themselves to know what sin is, repent of those sins, ask God to accept Jesus as your sacrifice for those sins, and sin no more being born again in spirit.

Should have used a machine that shoots a football at a crossbar,Against
"If Lampard had imparted sufficient top-spin to the ball it could have hit the line and acted the same way. I'm not saying he did, just that the possibility exists.",Neutral
"That may have been the case with Frank Lampard in 2010 where the ball did bounce back out hitting the cross bar on the way out, but when James Rodriguez scored one of his goals in the 2014 World Cup against Uruguay, not only did his shot hit the crossbar going in, but it hit the roof of the net, why did it happen with James and not Lampard?",Neutral
"While he does well to explain what actually happened in the world cup goal, I believe he is wrong when he says the only way a ball can hit the cross bar twice is if it goes inside the goal. The cross bar is curved so where the ball connects on the bar combined with what direction the ball is spining effects the outcome. Its entirely possible for a ball to have enough top spin as to where it will hit the cross bar, lose its top spin plunk straight down and bounce back up and hit the cross bar again.",Against
Germany ended up 4 goals anyways,Against
"Wrong. Back-spin is often present in powerful shots, which can cancel out the spin from the impact and make the ball bounce straight down. The ball can absolutely hit the crossbar twice without going in, and it's happened more than once. Lampard's shot was absolutely over the line, but this is not a method that should be used by referees, because it doesn't show for sure what happened. What they need is goal-line technology and replays, not an unreliable trick to guess that the ball probably crossed the line.",Against
shame science can't explain how england lost to iceland lol,Against
can you be a referee,Neutral
"Yes, Germany won 4-1. But momentum can be everything in football; had Lampard's goal been given, it would have been 2-2, England would have been flying and wouldn't have been chasing the game, while Germany would have been deflated from losing a two goal lead in two minutes. No question they were a better team than England (and overall deserved to win on the day) but who knows in such situations. 

Yeah yeah, 1966 and all that, but the decision over the contentious Hurst goal (or not) was nowhere near as blatantly wrong, and Germany have always had the rub of the green against England ever since then anyway. At least there's finally goal line technology now. All England need now is to get better at penalty kicks ;)",Favor

The ball can still bounce of the cross bar go in and not hit the crossbar on the way out. So yeah,Favor

"That's soccer, not football.",Against
"I really like this video - i could never work out when you throw a bouncy ball onto the floor with spin, it would bounce backwards and forwards, whereas other round objects would stay spinning/bouncing the same direction :)",Favor
Interesting. So it was physically impossible for it to have not been a goal. Interesting. ,Neutral
Germany still would've won because they were 4-1 up.,Against
I feel pain watching this,Against
It looks like u r rewinding it😂😂,Neutral
"This ended the World Cup for England, directly because of this, Germany scored their third goal, virtually ending the match. Huge difference in going in at half tied at 2 and being down 2.",Against
Why does FIFA need expensive goal line technology when they could just have a replay center that looks at all the goals scored? Many American sports have that and it works very well. I can just use my eyes too see if it's a goal or not...,Against
But how come this didn't happen with James Rodriguez goal against Uruguay?,Against
I guess the referee doesn't understand simple physics,Against
"Let's say it like this: England would have been totally destroyed, if the goal was given. They were way worse than the German side.",Against
The goalys hand was over the line and the ball was behind his hand,Against
"Actually this is nonsense, it all depends on which part of the width of the crossbar the ball makes contact with...ie: if the ball had hit the bar half an inch further in it would have hit the ground and bounced into the roof of the net, if it hiad hit the bar a half an inch further out it would have bounced on the line and out, this is what happened in the 1966 World Cup Final.",Against

This was posted on my 8th birthday ,
"I've seen in a few games this year the ball hits the bar then the line and into the roof of the net so there for I say this whole experiment its complete bollocks, don't get me wrong Lampards was in by a mile.",Against
1:10 to 1:23 I like how you assume that England would've won the cup....lol they're so overrated,Against
I knew that...,Irrelevant
"If the Lampard's shot hit the crossbar twice, should the experiment not demonstrate that the rubber ball hits the Perspex at the same place as well? I am basing my question on the fact that the crossbar is a rather narrow area to hit, and the ball did actually hit it twice. I have not been able to say the same with the experiment. I do not have a high speed camera as you, Sir, I would have loved to prove it myself :s Thank you <3",Against
"the harder u throw it seems to stop dead more, a stupid 'scientist' who has no clue!!!",Against
1:52 We should not forget that Zidane had that same type of goal in the World Cup final and it was counted.,Favor

Clearly didnt get in.,Against
"wake up people, with science videos like this you're best to not accept what they tell you unless their argument is completely watertight",Against
This video doesn't prove it. If the ball had alot of top spin once kicked it could replicate the results but remain in play.﻿,Against
This video doesn't prove it. If the ball had alot of top spin once kicked it could replicate the results but remain in play.,Against
"Lampard can kick the ball so it has some spin to begin with, so the ref can't make a judgment based on tabletop physics not knowing that factor. The new goal line tech is good. On the bright side, England was spared the shame which befell Spain.",Favor
"unless the ball is not in rubber, grass is not glass and if the ball touch the line (which is wide), there is no goal... That's why we have the goal line technology",Neutral
Fantastic explanation of some world cup physics. I thought out soccer ball video was brilliant - but this is great! Well done +The Royal Institution. ,Favor
"2 thoughts on that:
1. Does this work on very ruined grass or does this need a clean and plane pitch?
2. you need goal line technology for situations where the ball does not hit the bar, right? ;)",Against
what If the experiment done using a ping pong ball? ,Neutral
England lost because God wanted England to loose. Nothing to do with physics.,Against

"If you tilt the bottom side of the tunnel and give the ball a spin, is there no possibility the ball will go straight up with no spin?",Neutral
dam those referees and their lack of science knowledge,Against
but...if he kicked the ball so it had spin originally...couldnt it still drop directly on the line and bounce back up? ,Neutral
"thats one of the reasons why football sucks: because of some stupid tradition the referees use only their eyes. no playback, no super slow motion. which leads to tons of false decisions, and when the referees are looking elsewhere, the players can kick each others skulls in.",Against
"So... soccer refs blew a call... imagine that.

How about they get more than one blind idiot on the field at the same time... how STUPID are they that they only have one ref for the game with the biggest playing surface and some of the most fit athletes in the world?

Thinking that one guy is going to make all the right calls on-the-field is absurd, as is evidenced by the disgusting amount of faked injuries that get called as fouls.

Ruins the game for most Americans (I know the rest of the world couldn't give two craps, but your precious sport is full of actors and prima donnas that fake injuries... brutal)",Against
"For what it's worth, us dutchies gave them some nice goals to think about.

And don't forget who kicked germs ass in world war 1 and 2 cough cough England so shut tht up ure arse sideways,
No one denies this was a goal..the english for suredont .the germans dont...the international spectators dont..only the referee. I dont want to bring up some kind of justification for example wembley.  It was a horrible decision by the referee...no doubt about it. ,Against

Ha germans still didnt win wc though xD dont cheat next time nazi's ;),Against
"@choasknuckles17 
 not at all . ..  the ball was NOT over the line when he picked it up (it had already spun our of the goal), and what do you expect him to do?  stand there and say ""yup, the ball went in, ref.  blow your whistle and re-start the match at center.  it's 2-2"".",Against
1 german goal was of side and if england scored that they wouldev had faith and germany wouldent have,Against

Well you guys got a lucky goal-line call in 1966 so only far the Germans got one back ;-),Against
Jesus that’s shit commentary,Against
pmsl - at 2-2 anything could havehappened but on the balance of play england didn't deserve to go through. Hopelessly outfought and germany had so many chances..,Against

"The absolute worst broadcaster I have ever heard in my life!! For fucks sake, what were Talksport thinking bringing this guy across from the BBC. He is condescending, patronising, interrupts people every 10 seconds, just reels out one cliche after another and has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING of interest to say about anything! Agree with mothikas below, bring back Marcotti and get the spanish guy Balague on more often, they actually know what they're talking about. ",
