As an 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 fan, I can't explain how unlucky, if not cursed we are in tournament football! I've seen England get knocked out on penalties 7 times, seen key players like Owen, Rooney & Beckham hobble off in a couple of those very games, the latter even breaking their metatarsals on the verge of the tournament, seen Ronaldinho's freak goal make the difference, & even Kane missing a key penalty in the game against France in just the previous WC QF in Qatar. This Lampard goal is just another chapter in a truly heartbreaking history of following England! I pray i get to see lady luck finally favor England in my lifetime!!!

So... soccer refs blew a call... imagine that.

How about they get more than one blind idiot on the field at the same time... how STUPID are they that they only have one ref for the game with the biggest playing surface and some of the most fit athletes in the world?

Thinking that one guy is going to make all the right calls on-the-field is absurd, as is evidenced by the disgusting amount of faked injuries that get called as fouls.

Ruins the game for most Americans (I know the rest of the world couldn't give two craps, but your precious sport is full of actors and prima donnas that fake injuries... brutal)

### Input:
There's no way you can say this wouldn't have changed the game.

We went in 2-1 down, desperately needing a goal and massively disheartened. Both their goals in the 2nd half were goals on the break, largely caused by the fact we had to throw men forward. When the break for their 3rd goal began, we only had 1 defender outside of the attacking third.

If that had been scored, we'd have gone in 2-2. Level, just needing to hold our own, with the momentum and feeling confident. There's just no way you can pretend we'd be playing with 9 men in the final third in that situation.

Saying they won anyway is hugely misleading and completely misrepresentative. The game WOULD have panned out differently, and there's no way to say what would have happened.

### Input:
The typical arrogance. To think that a goal that wasn't given in the first half of a round of 16 match that ended 4-1 was the most shocking moment. Are you joking? Suarez' handball vs Ghana, and Africa, and every neutral, to reach the semi-finals that no African nation had ever reached before, in the very last seconds, with the very last kick of the game being missed by Gyan to take it to penalties. This was BY FAR the most shocking moment, and it's just sheer, sheer arrogance to believe that England feeling hard done by when they lost 4-1, to assume that that one Lampard goal would have made that much of a difference, is a bigger, more shocking moment. Typical.

Wow calm down you fools. One wrong decision doesnt mean the ref should die or retire or some shit.

What you guys so mad about? Yes it would have been an equalizer, but hell no were you any good in wc 2010. Im sorry guys but you lost cause you were the worse team, not cause of corruption or some shit.  

Also I like how your only wc title is one stained with this dirty goal in extra time while germans just won a round and didnt win the wc afterwards. (And were by far the better team, still remember neuers assist for klose :) )
