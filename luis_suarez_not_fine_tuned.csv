Luis suarez cost Ghanaians the world cup semi final because he knew he was going to lose.Ghana could have even gone to the final and beat spain,Against
"I remember at school at the time, people was calling him everything under the sun. I understood that he did what he had to do. Growing is realising that any of us in that position in the world cup would have done the exact same thing",Favor
This man clearly was often mentally unstable,Against
Stuff like that prove that morality always loses and nice guys always finish last,Against
Suarez speaking as if Uruguay won that world cup they didn't even get third place lol,Against
He will never step foot in Ghana,Against
he didnt even need to do that he coulda headered that easy,Against
By apolosing he would look stupid because players do worst than that I saw goalkeepers attack players and break there foot already to avoid them from scoring,Against
Like how is this NOT smart play? Players sometimes end up injuring players in the penalty area to defend a goal. This is why the penalty exists. A team can defend a goal however the hell they want to. It's your job to score the penalty. You missing a penalty means you suck,Against
Hand of Satan :D,Against
The rules should get changed at that point even if it doesn’t happen often. If a ball gets stopped on the line illegally the goal should count.,
"Dont play football at all, but what he did was perfectly fine in my opinion, if there is no rule to punish this harder: Hate the game not the player",Against
Where is the full interview?????🙏🙏🙏,Against
"Win at all costs. Isn’t that the true spirit of competition? I don’t blame Suarez, cuz I would have done the same thing.",Favor
Suarez is such a g 😂,Against
Africans cry somewhere else,Against
"Its not even his fault,he saved with hand and ghana would won because it was 120th minute but its correct to him to get red card and penalty to ghana but ghana player could score but he failed and then it was penalty-shoot out they could win on it but uruguay beated them",
Dirty cheating.... south American way,Against

Cheating is cheating .,Against
Ghana fans call the handball unsportsmanlike but when they see him crying when Uruguay gets knocked out they make fun of him. Stupid logic.,Against

You make the game looks ugly,Against
Respect the handball as much as a last man tackle to save a goal. Ive seen plenty of goalies and defenders foul on purpose to save a goal and its no different that what Suarez did,Against
He had no choice.   A chance vs losing the game.   It’s a no brainer.,Favor
It's a world cup I'd do the same,Favor
😭😭😭😭 Ghana should have won 😢 Uruguay suck 😡,Favor
How can someone pass out while celebrating😂😂,Neutral
If it was Jorge Fucile that saved (the other defender on the line who also tried handballing it) most people probably wouldn't blame him it's just cuz people don't like suarez,Against

If it wasnt suarez it was gonne be the dude next to him😭😭,Against

Never got the outcry for this,
One of the best save ever.....✨✨✨🇬🇷,Favor
Hakimi missed a pen against south africa just like this,Against
Suarez should have been disbarred from any further official football matches because of his actions. It was the most unsportsmanlike behavior since 1986's world cup match between ENG and ARG,Against
He’s quite similar to Maradona bro,Against
What an ingenious cheater😂,Against
Who's here after Suarez announced his retirement? 😢,Neutral
"He's announced his international retirement, streets will NEVER FORGET....",Favor
What is the name of that goal keeper,Neutral
I watch after his retirement anouncment  on 3/9/ 2024 who  watch this video now,Neutral
Unfortunately there was no rule for this. In such a case a referee should have just given 2 goals to Ghana instead of a penalty.,Against
This is one of the funniest moments of my lifetime,Favor
The guy next to him had the same idea,Neutral
mane i think if we was in the world cup we would all do this for our country,Favor
"He did what anyone would do in that situation. World Cup Quarters, seconds left before shootout, if the ball goes in at that point it’s game over…so of course he’s going to do that.",Neutral
What a joke as a player and a cheat,Against
"The true villain for ghana is their own player. Blame asamoah gyan for missed that penalty. He’s the one who eliminated ghana, not suarez",Against
"""Z"" in South America is pronounced ""S"", not ""TH"", unlike in Spain. So, Suarez sounds like ""Suares"" not ""Suareth"".",Favor
Suarez is the ultimate warrior of Uruguay,Favor
Clear goals like these should count automatically and not result into penalty.,Against

I love Suarez 😂😂😂💯,Favor
Brain dead rules in soccer. That should just obviously just straight up be a goal..,Against
Suarez is always famous for his golden tooth and golden hand. In Copa America 2024 he is in the news for allegedly biting a  Colombian footballer.😂,Against
Suarez did double safe. First one came from his legs and next from his hands.,Favor
"Shouldn’t have been a penalty. It should have been an automatic goal. If his hands weren’t there, it would have gone in, full stop. How is Suarez still allowed to play in FIFA games after so much controversy???",Against
"What a shameful chapter in world football. As a Liverpool fan, I was conflicted about his contributions; you just hoped he wouldn't attack anyone and get sent off, shaming the club.",Against
Ojalá haber estado ahí! Estoy esforzándome para ir al próximo mundial 🤩🔥⚽️,Neutral
he tried to play it off like it never happened,Against
"For those saying that Suarez is a hero - I’ll do a handball in my next game!! In fact, I’ll do it in every game - why not? And also - every defender should practice handballs for these situations!!",Against
I dont understand why that goal wasnt simply given. It would have been one without that handplay,Against
Suarez did what he had to do,
"Nobody talking about it was a penalty anyway, look at number 6 he's smashing the Ghana attacker with his foot",Against
Why are they mad at Suarez anyways? They should be mad at their guy missing a penalty kick.,Against
"That goal should have been awarded + a penalty on top of the player being shown a red card. You simply cannot, should not cheat and win.",Against
We're glorifying cheaters now?,Against
What did they call the Ghana National Team??? 😂,Neutral

One of the most despicable fouls from an already despicable player.,Against
"In the ref country, you will continue play, if you play in blue or red",Favor
Like..Suarez could have just used his head instead to get the ball away from the goal. There was no need for his hands to make that save..,Against
Even after 14 years it feels like my heart is still beating fast after this match.,Favor
"The footballs rules lol, a redcart and a penalty, why not a goal ?",Against
the only unsportsmanlike thing here is the blatant dive at 2:05. Karma that they missed the penalty.,Favor

Any team and any player in that critical situation would have done the same if in the same position. Not on Suarez but on Gyan for missing that penalty kick. Uruguay Para siempre 🇺🇾,Favor
Ironically that ball was going straight at his head.. he could have just headed it,Against
suarez is an absolute disgrace to football hes got no respect for anyone,Against
He turned that goal chance from 100% to 50/50. Call it a cheat but I think any pro player would have done that to win the game on the biggest stage.,Favor
"Suárez is a clear example of what an athlete should NEVER be. In my opinion that should've counted as a Goal and not a penalti, after all it was going In. We need a change on the rules, so to prevent other players from doing the same",Against
"Why do people complain, it's still a part of the game. You commit that, your team gets a red card so you play as 10 and enemy team gets a free penalty. I don't find it as cheating at all, these are the rules, the referee gave the red and the penalty, so no reason to complain.",Favor
The free kick from Ghana was not real. Look it up on google images. Dude was at least 1 1/2 meters away from the Uruguay defense. FiFA wanted to Africa to pass to make it seem real,
That’s the game that made me hate Suarez! Bad luck for Ghana that had a solid team! Respect from Morocco 🇲🇦 Africa united 🙏🏽,Against
He almost single-handedly won the premier league title for Liverpool. What a player he is...,Favor

"i dont get why suarez is hated by ghana so much, they literally missed their own penalty",Against
It was painful I am sure for the Ghana fabs but I must say that if they had the same opportunity at that point of time they too would have utilised it. The end justifies the means.,Favor
"When coaches say ""do whatever it takes"" players like Suarez take it literally 🧛‍♂️",Against
"This is why he isnt top player, because this is the worst thing he has done, but remember the 3 bites, or the 5000000 times he was pulling, and pinching, and scratching players, but because he was at Barca all that was allowed, he was allowed to use a players head for jumping and scoring because he its Barca, fifas favorite team. Fair play went away with him and others like him, and also fifa ;)",Against
Tactical fouls happen every game.. the ckrrect punishment was given to Suarez of a red card and a penalty.. tacticcal fouls happen literally all the time but just cause yall dont like this player and wanted the african team to win you decide to start crying about it,Against

History cannot be deleted ….. The game soccer will always always remember this moment! Ghana 🇬🇭 will be in the books forever 😢,Against
A classic save forever,Favor
"There should be a rule where if a team stops the ball on the line with a hand, it is an automatic goal. A penalty is only 80% chance of a goal statistically. They already did enough to score and they are forced to do it again? Unfair, and shows that cheating works.",Against
"If I want to save my family from death by sacrificing myself, I will do that because I love my family. I don't get my point well, there's a problem for you. Literally, Luiz Suarez did that. Call him cheater or what, he did that to save his country from elimination.",Favor

This guy needs mental health help. There's something clearly wrong with him.,Against
Why is Suarez praised for this here and the African fans called crybabies then Thierry Henry does the same thing against Ireland and he's labeled a cheat? And we pretend racism doesn't exist in football.,Against
why have they instantly complained to the referee after suarez did the handball if they played on maybe they would've scored afterwards.,
Theres no mistake in it he got a red card and ghana got a penalty .even bigger sides struggle at penalty at wc sometimes,
Scummiest move in the world cup. And that includes Italy taking a dive for penalty vs NZ. Ghana deserved win,Against

"You win, but so ashamed sport",Against
Shockingly you can't just blame Suarez for Ghana's defeat. It's the player who missed the penalty.,Favor

I bet ghana qualifying😢😢😢,Against
"And in the next match we saw him crying 😂😂😂, that gave me happiness",Favor
Nobody talks that this play originates from a terrible dive of the Ghana player which is not a foul.,
"Suárez did what everyone would do to save their national team, also Ghana cheated during the whole match, even the free kick that caused the hand of Suárez at the end. In 2022 there was no revenge since Uruguay won again and the results were because of Portugal and Korea.",Favor

Watching Suarez cry at Qatar was one of the highlights of the tournament.,Against
i feel like they should've got a goal for that. i mean he wasn't going to save it any other way,Favor
Was the right thing to do honestly. I don't know why we don't we have more incidents like this. Use all means necessary to keep your team in the running. Punishment is penalty/ red card?  I'll take that deal.,Favor

A handball to prevent a goal is the same as hacking down a forward on a breakaway. Red card but saves the goal. Nobody can say honestly that they wouldnt do either of these things to have a chance to win the world cup,Favor

"This is fine. It' not like his foul went unpunished. He basically sacrificed himself to give Uruguay one more chance at preventing a goal, which worked. It's a tactical foul.",
Ghana shouldn't have had their free kick that led to Suarez handball. The linesman totally gifted them freekick.,Against
Suarez the great defender,Favor
Just give Suarez the trophy at that point. No one wanted it more! 🤣,Favor
That's just disgusting and disrespectful.,Against
Suarez saved Uruguay single handedly. Actually with both hands.,Favor
"He literally was given a red card and was kicked off the game, what more did you want him to get? He received the correct punishment for his actions, what revenge did you guys want? This is ridiculous ALSO THE GHANA PLAYERS CELEBRATED HIM LEAVING AND THEN LOST THE PENALTY SHOT THAT WAS ON THEM what revenge did you want? Losing to a team because you missed a penalty shot? Lame",Favor
"Forlán was and will always be one of the best players in the world and in Uruguay’s history, I missed him this world cup",Favor
"He literally was given a red card and was kicked off the game, what more did you want him to get? He received the correct punishment for his actions, what revenge did you guys want? This is ridiculous",Against
That hand ball should be given goal,Against
ah now i know😅,Neutral
morocco🇲🇦 did it 🥳🥳,
A legendary brainy saves!🔥,Favor
morocco completed the dream of africa after 12 years,Favor
Suarez took matters into his own hands,Against
"EPIC... whether you approve or disapprove, this is simply EPIC",Favor
"This happened to me when I played soccer for my school. The goalkeeper went down blocking a shot and the rebound landed straight at my feet. All I had to do was launch it over him and it was an instant goal. As the ball was sailing under the crossbar and we started to celebrate a defender came out of nowhere and blocked it just like a goalkeeper. We stood amazed and said, ""You can't do that!"" We converted the penalty. The scorer said to me after that the goal belonged to me, but we also talked how smart that defender was and how we should do the same thing in that situation.",Neutral
suarez what a hero,Favor
"Great play tbh. If you let the ball go in your down one & probably lose. If you handball it out like he did and force them to shoot the penalty, there's at least a CHANCE they miss. And they did!   High IQ play in the blink of eye, and it looks even more genius when you can reflect and consider both options.",Favor
"Ahahahaha, Suarez if amazing",Favor
Finally Ghana took revenge for this in 2022,Against
a lot of africans said they got revenge and that is kinda true but a group stage match will never compare to a quarter finals match. The damage Suarez inflicted to Ghana will always haunt them until they can finally reach a semi final.,Against
Suarez  best goal keeper,Against
And that kind of actions is made acceptable just because the rules are not well made.,
Ghana we feel your pain,Favor
Anyway he was a Hero of his country.,Neutral
Ghana was supposed to win it doesn't matter if you were given a penalty as the ball was already going in,Favor
If you ain''t cheatin' you aint tryin' -Suarez (Probably),Against
he was and is a cheat,Against
"Do the rules prevent the goal from being awarded by the referee?  Off sides goals are allowed to be scored all the time even after the flag goes up, and are subsequently taken away rightfully.",Against
The Best ever painful game Ghana have ever had.,
karma never forget the address.,Against
Suarez did the right thing ... 😂😂,Against
shameful way to defend their team for Suarez.,Against
win at all cost? dude f&^k suarez,Against
Maradona : Hand Of God,
No-one ever mentions the other dude on the line,Against
Forget the red card in that situation where there is a blatant illegal obstruction the only fair outcome is an automatic goal to the attacking team,Favor
Fifa should introduce new rule that in this kind of situation it should have been directly given goal n red card to the player. Since there was no keeper to save any more and only bcoz of Suarez's hand goal didnt happen! In future let not any nation be victim of this kind of act!,Against
Thank you korea😂😂😂😂,Neutral
Suarez is the complete player .Respect.,Favor
We could tell Ghanaians played their heart out till last min a few days ago in  2022 world cup .,
“Suarez had single-handedly guided his team to a penalty shootout”,
Karma Luis Suarez in Qatar land world cup 2022,Against
