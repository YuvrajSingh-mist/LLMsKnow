Luis suarez cost Ghanaians the world cup semi final because he knew he was going to lose.Ghana could have even gone to the final and beat spain,Against
"I remember at school at the time, people was calling him everything under the sun. I understood that he did what he had to do. Growing is realising that any of us in that position in the world cup would have done the exact same thing",Favor
This man clearly was often mentally unstable,Against
Stuff like that prove that morality always loses and nice guys always finish last,Against
Suarez speaking as if Uruguay won that world cup they didn't even get third place lol,Against
He will never step foot in Ghana,Against
he didnt even need to do that he coulda headered that easy,Against
By apolosing he would look stupid because players do worst than that I saw goalkeepers attack players and break there foot already to avoid them from scoring,Against
Like how is this NOT smart play? Players sometimes end up injuring players in the penalty area to defend a goal. This is why the penalty exists. A team can defend a goal however the hell they want to. It's your job to score the penalty. You missing a penalty means you suck,Against
Hand of Satan :D,Against
"The rules should get changed at that point even if it doesn’t happen often. If a ball gets stopped on the line illegally the goal should count.
In basketball it’s similar. If a player stops the ball going to the basket and already being in a downfall it counts as 2 or 3 points immediately.",Against
"Dont play football at all, but what he did was perfectly fine in my opinion, if there is no rule to punish this harder: Hate the game not the player",Against
Where is the full interview?????🙏🙏🙏,Against
"Win at all costs. Isn’t that the true spirit of competition? I don’t blame Suarez, cuz I would have done the same thing.",Favor
Suarez is such a g 😂,Against
Africans cry somewhere else,Against
"Its not even his fault,he saved with hand and ghana would won because it was 120th minute but its correct to him to get red card and penalty to ghana but ghana player could score but he failed and then it was penalty-shoot out they could win on it but uruguay beated them
Its not fair to save ball with hand but he missed next game,got red card and penalty to them so🤷",Against
Dirty cheating.... south American way,Against
"“No le pegué la patada a nadie, no le mordí a nadie…”",Neutral
"At the same time I am proud of Suarez, but sad that its with Ghana. I would like it happend with some top team, for whom semi-finals would not be that big dream, but popular sad story they lost😅",Favor
Cheating is cheating .,Against
Ghana fans call the handball unsportsmanlike but when they see him crying when Uruguay gets knocked out they make fun of him. Stupid logic.,Against

"""The Ghana player missing the penalty is not my fault"" 🔥💪👑",Against
I would have done the same lol,Neutral
You make the game looks ugly,Against
Respect the handball as much as a last man tackle to save a goal. Ive seen plenty of goalies and defenders foul on purpose to save a goal and its no different that what Suarez did,Against
He had no choice.   A chance vs losing the game.   It’s a no brainer.,Favor
It's a world cup I'd do the same,Favor
😭😭😭😭 Ghana should have won 😢 Uruguay suck 😡,Favor
How can someone pass out while celebrating😂😂,Neutral
If it was Jorge Fucile that saved (the other defender on the line who also tried handballing it) most people probably wouldn't blame him it's just cuz people don't like suarez,Against
The best number 9 we have seen does everything for his international team,Favor
What a despicable excuse for a  man,Against
"The hands never bothered me as much as the bite. The hands, I thought, were an interesting take on a way to play with the rules of the game, a risk/reward calculation.",Against
If it wasnt suarez it was gonne be the dude next to him😭😭,Against
"He did it, he got punished for it the , Ghana was given a penalty all by the book maybe the ghanaian player should have scored the penalty",Against
No mordi a nadie jajajja,Neutral
"Suarez would even bite for his team, let alone handball",Against
what's the other person's name??,Neutral
"That hand was disgusting. So anti fair play. He blocked a goal that was already done.
Anybody can miss a penalty. Penalty was not a good compensation",Against
tbh there is nothing to explain,Neutral

One of the best save ever.....✨✨✨🇬🇷,Favor
Hakimi missed a pen against south africa just like this,Against
Suarez should have been disbarred from any further official football matches because of his actions. It was the most unsportsmanlike behavior since 1986's world cup match between ENG and ARG,Against
He’s quite similar to Maradona bro,Against
What an ingenious cheater😂,Against
Who's here after Suarez announced his retirement? 😢,Neutral
"He's announced his international retirement, streets will NEVER FORGET....",Favor
What is the name of that goal keeper,Neutral
I watch after his retirement anouncment  on 3/9/ 2024 who  watch this video now,Neutral
Unfortunately there was no rule for this. In such a case a referee should have just given 2 goals to Ghana instead of a penalty.,Against
This is one of the funniest moments of my lifetime,Favor
The guy next to him had the same idea,Neutral
mane i think if we was in the world cup we would all do this for our country,Favor
"He did what anyone would do in that situation. World Cup Quarters, seconds left before shootout, if the ball goes in at that point it’s game over…so of course he’s going to do that.",Neutral
What a joke as a player and a cheat,Against
"The true villain for ghana is their own player. Blame asamoah gyan for missed that penalty. He’s the one who eliminated ghana, not suarez",Against
"""Z"" in South America is pronounced ""S"", not ""TH"", unlike in Spain. So, Suarez sounds like ""Suares"" not ""Suareth"".",Favor
Suarez is the ultimate warrior of Uruguay,Favor
Clear goals like these should count automatically and not result into penalty.,Against

I love Suarez 😂😂😂💯,Favor
Brain dead rules in soccer. That should just obviously just straight up be a goal..,Against
Suarez is always famous for his golden tooth and golden hand. In Copa America 2024 he is in the news for allegedly biting a  Colombian footballer.😂,Against
Suarez did double safe. First one came from his legs and next from his hands.,Favor
"Shouldn’t have been a penalty. It should have been an automatic goal. If his hands weren’t there, it would have gone in, full stop. How is Suarez still allowed to play in FIFA games after so much controversy???",Against
"What a shameful chapter in world football. As a Liverpool fan, I was conflicted about his contributions; you just hoped he wouldn't attack anyone and get sent off, shaming the club.",Against
Ojalá haber estado ahí! Estoy esforzándome para ir al próximo mundial 🤩🔥⚽️,Neutral
he tried to play it off like it never happened,Against
"For those saying that Suarez is a hero - I’ll do a handball in my next game!! In fact, I’ll do it in every game - why not? And also - every defender should practice handballs for these situations!!",Against
I dont understand why that goal wasnt simply given. It would have been one without that handplay,Against
"Suarez did what he had to do
Everyone complaining here would have done the same for their national team",Against
"Nobody talking about it was a penalty anyway, look at number 6 he's smashing the Ghana attacker with his foot",Against
Why are they mad at Suarez anyways? They should be mad at their guy missing a penalty kick.,Against
"That goal should have been awarded + a penalty on top of the player being shown a red card. You simply cannot, should not cheat and win.",Against
We're glorifying cheaters now?,Against
What did they call the Ghana National Team??? 😂,Neutral
Hand of devil 😂,Against
biggest hater moment ever,Against
suarez intellectually made a dumb move,Against

One of the most despicable fouls from an already despicable player.,Against
"In the ref country, you will continue play, if you play in blue or red",Favor
Like..Suarez could have just used his head instead to get the ball away from the goal. There was no need for his hands to make that save..,Against
Even after 14 years it feels like my heart is still beating fast after this match.,Favor
"The footballs rules lol, a redcart and a penalty, why not a goal ?",Against
the only unsportsmanlike thing here is the blatant dive at 2:05. Karma that they missed the penalty.,Favor

"Disgraceful, very unsportsmanlike",Against
Any team and any player in that critical situation would have done the same if in the same position. Not on Suarez but on Gyan for missing that penalty kick. Uruguay Para siempre 🇺🇾,Favor
Ironically that ball was going straight at his head.. he could have just headed it,Against
suarez is an absolute disgrace to football hes got no respect for anyone,Against
He turned that goal chance from 100% to 50/50. Call it a cheat but I think any pro player would have done that to win the game on the biggest stage.,Favor
"Suárez is a clear example of what an athlete should NEVER be. In my opinion that should've counted as a Goal and not a penalti, after all it was going In. We need a change on the rules, so to prevent other players from doing the same",Against
"Why do people complain, it's still a part of the game. You commit that, your team gets a red card so you play as 10 and enemy team gets a free penalty. I don't find it as cheating at all, these are the rules, the referee gave the red and the penalty, so no reason to complain.",Favor
"The free kick from Ghana was not real. Look it up on google images. Dude was at least 1 1/2 meters away from the Uruguay defense. FiFA wanted to Africa to pass to make it seem real
Google images ""Uruguay ghana free kick""
You are welcome. Ghana cheated",Against
That’s the game that made me hate Suarez! Bad luck for Ghana that had a solid team! Respect from Morocco 🇲🇦 Africa united 🙏🏽,Against

Name of song please❤❤❤,Neutral
That's evil,Against
so much respect for what suarez did in this game,Favor
"i dont get why suarez is hated by ghana so much, they literally missed their own penalty",Against
It was painful I am sure for the Ghana fabs but I must say that if they had the same opportunity at that point of time they too would have utilised it. The end justifies the means.,Favor
"When coaches say ""do whatever it takes"" players like Suarez take it literally 🧛‍♂️",Against
"This is why he isnt top player, because this is the worst thing he has done, but remember the 3 bites, or the 5000000 times he was pulling, and pinching, and scratching players, but because he was at Barca all that was allowed, he was allowed to use a players head for jumping and scoring because he its Barca, fifas favorite team. Fair play went away with him and others like him, and also fifa ;)",Against
Tactical fouls happen every game.. the ckrrect punishment was given to Suarez of a red card and a penalty.. tacticcal fouls happen literally all the time but just cause yall dont like this player and wanted the african team to win you decide to start crying about it,Against

History cannot be deleted ….. The game soccer will always always remember this moment! Ghana 🇬🇭 will be in the books forever 😢,Against
A classic save forever,Favor
"There should be a rule where if a team stops the ball on the line with a hand, it is an automatic goal. A penalty is only 80% chance of a goal statistically. They already did enough to score and they are forced to do it again? Unfair, and shows that cheating works.",Against
"If I want to save my family from death by sacrificing myself, I will do that because I love my family. I don't get my point well, there's a problem for you. Literally, Luiz Suarez did that. Call him cheater or what, he did that to save his country from elimination.",Favor

This guy needs mental health help. There's something clearly wrong with him.,Against
Why is Suarez praised for this here and the African fans called crybabies then Thierry Henry does the same thing against Ireland and he's labeled a cheat? And we pretend racism doesn't exist in football.,Against
"why have they instantly complained to the referee after suarez did the handball if they played on maybe they would've scored afterwards.
They would've got the penalty either way if they didn't score..",Against

Scummiest move in the world cup. And that includes Italy taking a dive for penalty vs NZ. Ghana deserved win,Against
Imagine making the whole country hate you..Suarez=Chaos...literally love this guy,Against
"You win, but so ashamed sport",Against
Shockingly you can't just blame Suarez for Ghana's defeat. It's the player who missed the penalty.,Favor
No one in Suarez's position would stand there and let the ball go in over their head. He did what he had to.,Favor

"That fighting spirit and nasty edge got Suarez so far in his career. This is clearly not fair play, but the sacrifice he made was quite legendary.

Nobody talk how the number 10 of Ghana was in offside before Suarez handball,Against
"This is fine. It' not like his foul went unpunished. He basically sacrificed himself to give Uruguay one more chance at preventing a goal, which worked. It's a tactical foul.

Now if the referee hadn't penalized Uruguay for the foul, then it'd be a different story.",Favor
Ghana shouldn't have had their free kick that led to Suarez handball. The linesman totally gifted them freekick.,Against
Suarez the great defender,Favor
Just give Suarez the trophy at that point. No one wanted it more! 🤣,Favor

Suarez saved Uruguay single handedly. Actually with both hands.,Favor

"This happened to me when I played soccer for my school. The goalkeeper went down blocking a shot and the rebound landed straight at my feet. All I had to do was launch it over him and it was an instant goal. As the ball was sailing under the crossbar and we started to celebrate a defender came out of nowhere and blocked it just like a goalkeeper. We stood amazed and said, ""You can't do that!"" We converted the penalty. The scorer said to me after that the goal belonged to me, but we also talked how smart that defender was and how we should do the same thing in that situation.",Neutral
suarez what a hero,Favor
"Great play tbh. If you let the ball go in your down one & probably lose. If you handball it out like he did and force them to shoot the penalty, there's at least a CHANCE they miss. And they did!   High IQ play in the blink of eye, and it looks even more genius when you can reflect and consider both options.",Favor
"Ahahahaha, Suarez if amazing",Favor
Finally Ghana took revenge for this in 2022,Against
a lot of africans said they got revenge and that is kinda true but a group stage match will never compare to a quarter finals match. The damage Suarez inflicted to Ghana will always haunt them until they can finally reach a semi final.,Against
Suarez  best goal keeper,Against

"Honestly in a situation where a player does a foul like this, the other team should get two penalities.
The first to compensate for the goal that they would have had otherwise.
The second to punish the other team for using a tactic as dirty as this.

"Also, people in the comments misunderstand something. Fouls, handballs etc. are NOT part of the game. The game encapsulates what you CAN do, when you go outside what is allowable in the game, then you are penalized. So, by winning by going outside of the rules of the game, yes you can argue that you were penalized, but you still did not win based on football terms. That would be like saying that football is a game that allows reckless challenges, street fights and handballs, but we just show these yellow and red things. The penalties are not deemed to forfeit the game generally, so as not to be too extreme, but let us not pretend that when the game rules are broken, that it represents the game. The logic is basically ""what you did was deemed to be not too severe as to result in forfeiture, as you can be punished in another way"", but it still presents the possibility that a game can be won outside of the game itself. Football is not so complex as to account for all of these loopholes, but yes it was a loophole that was exploited. One could argue that such deliberate tactics to avoid playing within the rules of the game should result in forfeiture.",Favor

"Ghana could have still won that match...but staying true to form, when the time to put our game face on, we regressed to typical ghanaian mode. we never know when to focus and we never know when to turn the fun switch off. See the lackadasical attitude in the way the Ghanaian players were shooting the ball during the penalty kick. It was almost as if there was nothing at stake. they were playing as if it was a friendly match.",Against
He should have been banned for at least a whole year for doing that that is so disrespectful to the game. Like that's basically cheating you know it's going to go in and you're going to raise your hand on purpose not even on accident it was all on purpose.,Against

Suarez GK Shapeshifter when?,Against
"Ghana had no right to complain or feel robbed at all.

Dominic Adiyiah clearly dived to win the originating free-kick, and it was hit shot that Suarez blocked. So two wrongs made a right. How unfair would it have been for Uruguay to have knocked out of the World Cup from a free-kick win a by a huge dive, with the diver himself scoring. 

Plus Appiah was offside in the run-up to the handball incident, so any goal should have been disallowed for that anyway. 

Plus Uruguay had a blatant penalty not awarded earlier in extra-time when Paintsil fouled Abreu in the box. So Uruguay going through was justice, as was the fact that Adiyiah missed his penalty in the shootout while Abreu won it with an excellent paneka.",Against

Fun facts : Luis Suarez goalkeeping stats skyrocketed high up after this match.,Favor
"Nobody ever noticed that it was offside. When the goalie sprints forward to hit the ball and Ghana’s number 5 hit the with the head, Ghana’s number 10 was offside since he tried to play the ball afterwards. He’s ahead of the goalie with just Suarez as the last defender.",Against
"People ALWAYS forget that the free kick that caused all of this was one of the clearest dives in WC HISTORY, and that's not all, TWO players from Ghana were offside as soon as the player hit the ball and more after the ball was inside the area, it truly felt like the referees were doing it on purpose. So yeah, Suarez's handball wasn't exactly fair play, but better check the facts straight before satisfying you own sense of ""justice"" by thinking Ghana deserved to win.",Against
Unfortunately Ghana didn’t realize that the other team had multiple goalkeepers.,Neutral

"todo el mundo juzgo la mano de Suarez pero poca gente se detiene a ver que el tiro libre previo a la jugada nace de una falta inexistente a un jugador de Ghana que se deja caer y esta como a un metro del jugador uruguayo mas cercano. Eso si es trampa porque el jugador de Ghana engaña al juez y se cobra una falta a favor que nunca debió ser sancionada. La mano de Suarez es sancionada con tiro penal y expulsion. Yo me pregunto que hubiese pasado si no se sancionaba la primera falta, no expulsaban a Suarez y Uruguay hubiese contado con el para enfrentar a Holanda en semifinales. La historia depende del que la cuenta siempre. Para mi fue Karma instantáneo y Ghana no tiene nada que reclamar",Favor

"The title is not fair to Luis. It should have been  ""Suárez heroic moment"". That is for us, uruguayans. Moreover, the free kick that initiated that series of events was an erroneus decision of the referee, because It was no foul, the ghanean player fell down all by himself. And the result was that we had to face the semi final without Suárez. The Dutch were very much relieved, since they knew Luis too well and feared to receive his goals.",Against

This was one of the most unsporting and outrageous fouls in the history of soccer. Suarez should have been permanently barred from club and national team play. Just watching this video (and seeing Suarez celebrate at 2:42) made me furious all over again.,Against

Reminder that the play was a faul that never happened and from an offside,Against
How incredibly convenient that you skipped over and didn't mention that the 'foul' giving Ghana the free kick didn't exist. The Ghanaian player trips all by himself which means Suarez never should have been off. FIFA corruption in plain view.,Against

FIFA should take a look at what rugby does with the penalty tries given for intentional fouls near the try line. Making it an automatic goal in the case where a player intentionally hand balls on the goal line should be an automatic goal to avoid situations like this from happening again.,Against

"Luis Suarez should visit us in Ghana one of these days, a town called Ashaiman,Tulaku",Favor
"I think that handballs on the line like that should just result in an awarded goal. In hockey when the net is empty and someone is brought down on breakaway its an awarded goal (even if there is a very slim chance that person would have missed) Penalty kicks sometimes give a greater advantage then the chance nullified in the box by a foul anyways... and yes its still cheating if you get punished, the punishments are there to discourage people from cheating (breaking the rules for your advantage) otherwise things like cheating on your spouse isn't cheating if you get a divorce, try telling the next girl you have never cheated because you got divorced as a consequence. Also, once you serve your sentence for a crime, you still have a criminal record. It was cheating, it was dirty,  but it was a smart, competitive play by Suarez, can't deny that.",Against

Two simple rules are involved here:
1. A goal is only given when the ball crosses the line.
2. A player who intentionally touches the ball with his hand in the penalty area will be given a red card.

Suarez used his hand to prevent the ball from going in and he was rightfully punished with a red card.

"fun fact:
if you play the scene again, you'll see that suarez was not the only uruguay outfield player trying to reach the ball with hands, someone else also did it right from him
it only indicates that any player would do the same thing given the same situation
or would africans feel easier if that player touched the ball instead of suarez, while the resulting penalty was still missed?",Against
"It's never remembered as a hero, but a coward!!",Against

I remember coming home from work and sitting down realized this was on. I watched cause I had no dog in the race. By far one of the best matches ever. The fact this happened at the end of the game was the cherry on top.,Neutral
As much as you want to blame Suarez it's Ghana fault for missing the penalty.  Truth Hurts,Against
"‘Moment of madness’ was really a totally rational thing to do... even if you feel sorry for Ghana and don’t like how Suarez reacted to the miss, it was a completely sensible action...",Favor
I felt so sad for Ghana but in order to avoid this in future I hope that that hand ball rule will be changed by 2022 ..any handball in the penalty area should  remain a penalty but any handball by an outfield player to deny a definite goal should be awarded as a goal. I hope VAR plays a huge part in changing and determining the rule. The game should remain fair at all costs. I think the best punishment is not a red-card and a penalty in this case. Just make it a goal without any further punishment to the offender.,Against
"2:05 that created foul at the end, which led to the free kick which ended in Suarez handball, and you only remember what suarez did, while forget what the referee did


they tried to kick us out of the world cup, and they couldn't",Against
"If there was a cheater was Ghana. The free kick that was given to them at minute 120 was the last attempt from the refs trying to help Ghana advance. That was the most ridiculous dive ever, Fucile was 5 feet away from the Ghana player. Ghana dived all game long against Uruguay and against the US too, so stop whining already. Ghana injured Lugano, Lodeiro and almost killed Fucile. Suarez only gave them their coin back. Suarez and Lugano had been available to play against Holland Uruguay would have been finalist. The better team won 2:05",Against
"Thats such a condensending title, I'm guessing FIFA hates Suarez that much, love him or hate him he's one of the best players in the world right now",Against

"Some said this was controversial. But not to me. Call it controversy if suarez manage to get away with yellow card / no card at all. Or if ghana wasn't given a penalty. Ghana got their reward, suarez got his punishment. Gyan could be a national hero if that penalty didn't hit the crossbar. And suarez would be a national loser if gyan succeed.

FIF TV forgot to show how the referees were very biased in favour of Ghana througout the whole match.,Against

I get why people hate the fact that suarez did this but i think its just incredibily smart,Against
"I can't believe people only see one point of view when it comes to this infamous game! Like as if nobody out there would've not taken the same decision luis Suarez did to hand ball the ball out of the net to stave off elimination. As if no one from no other nation, placed in the position wouldn't have done the same, knowing that if that ball goes in, you're team is eliminated and that's the end of your world cup; and knowing this, and being any other nation other than Uruguay, that that player in that position like Luis Suarez wouldn't have instinctively done the same to prevent elimination! I personally think anybody in a situation like that would've done the same thing, to prolong their world cup journey, and to see what would happen after some disastrous move in order to prevent their team from being eliminated, I think they would've tinkered with that uncertainty and done the same thing. 



And now Ghanaians are mad at Uruguay because they were eliminated,  bit truth be told, Gyan had the biggest chance in the world to take his team to the next stage of the finals, and statistically, a penalty shot is almost always made. And he erred it! who can he blame but himself for not making the shot.",Favor

"Seriously, you have to be some kind of deluded Liverpool fan to think that Suarez is less of a cheater than Maradona or Henry simply because the ref in his match was better than the ref in theirs. He did the EXACT same thing they did and would have gotten away with it if he could, not to mention he's a totally classless player in general.",Against
"They ""intentionally got away with it"". But like I just said, their getting away with it has nothing to do with anything. If Suarez had gotten away with it, it's not like he would have asked the ref to red card him. 

You can't say that someone is only a criminal when they get caught. Violating a rule to gain unfair advantage is cheating. He was punished for cheating. Using your hand to stop a goal is cheating. That's WHY you get punished for it.
",Against
"cheat ""act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage"". He did not cheat, he did something against the rules and he got punished accordingly. To me, he did not act dishonestly or unfairly. Is exactly like when a defender makes an intentional challenge to stop a dangerous attacking play. The other 2 situations are cheating because they intentionally got away with it. Armstrong got punished retroactively, for doping. Had he been caught during a tour, he wouldn't have got a cheated win.",Against
"I don't understand how Henry or Maradona's handball is worse than Suarez? Just because Suarez got caught and red carded? But that's entirely on the ref.

By your logic, if Suarez hadn't been seen hand balling by the ref, he would have been cheating.

Fact is, all three were cheating. They violated the rules to stop a goal and their teams won because of it (or at least were greatly helped by it). It's like saying Lance Armstrong didnt' cheat because he's gotten a maximum penalty for his crime.",Against
"This is silly, he didn't cheat at all, he did not escape punishment, nor he tried to. He did something against the rules and got a fair and maximum punishment for it (out of the game and missed the following match). Asamoah, Essien or any player from Ghana, for what it matters would have done exactly the same had he found himself in a similar position. You want cheating?

For example, I think if you moved the penalty kick line a few meters further back so that it was perhaps a 50-50 chance of scoring and not like 80-20 that more penalties would be called. Also, offsides should not exist within a few meters of the goal.",Against

"The problem is football is not about fairness - it is not really even a sport. There is no official time that is kept, penalty kicks are only awarded in rare circumstances even though fouls are committed constantly in the penalty box on each corner kick, plus there are players diving and faking injuries all the time. Suarez did exactly what players do in every football game. They stopped a goal through committing a foul. If you don't like the rules of football, get them changed. Don't whine!",Against
Because I don't support cheating and instead I apply the rules of the game with the basic ability of using common sense?

In this situation if I was refereeing I would have just given the goal and if Uruguay complained I would have said ""You want to admit to cheating?""

Suarez intentionally handled the ball to prevent a goal, and give a penalty instead (a penalty is a major downgrade from a definite goal). In other words he gained an advantage in the competitive situation, which as I defined before, is cheating. 

As is in any sport, cheating must be taken out of the game, through changing of the rules. ",Against

The day i just hated this guy and still do. Worse still he blames the missed penalty on the player and deflects to say wasn’t my fault. Then when the penalty was missed at the time the world saw him jumping up and down in delight.,Against

“Ain’t my fault if the guy ain’t scorin.”,Against
"Un grandísimo jugador, pero tremendo tramposo",Against
"Anybody defending this doesn’t understand how football works. The only person who can touch the ball by hand is the goalkeeper, full stop. The red card is there to say “This is more than just a penalty. You completely broke the basis of the game, and this should never be done.” There is a reason he was sent off. Ghana should have been awarded that goal automatically.

Saying he doesn’t need to apologize sets a dangerous precedent where any defender can use their hands in a situation where the goalkeeper is gone to attempt to mitigate a goal. That is not how football works. There is a reason there is only one goalkeeper.

I will always cheer against Uruguay until Suarez retires.",Favor
Same bro. That’s a true patriot here,Favor
He is professionell und does everything whats necessary for winning. Apologize for what? He got his punishment.,Favor

No he is wrong because he saved the ball no one was behind him and put Ghanaian to kick new ball and they missed !! But if he did touch the first ball with his had it’s definitely scored!! So he should apologise!!!,Against

I've never heard Suarez speak English before 😳,Neutral
He has the point,Favor

While I understand it was great to see him tear up today! Karma served nice and hot! 😊,Against
His tears are my 2022 World Cup highlight so far.,Neutral
"Also for everyone saying he shouldn’t apologize:  he stood as a player on the line of the goal and used his hands to prevent the goal.  It’s the same thing as a boxer punching the back of the head of another boxer, knowing they’ll lose a point, but risking the win.  And no it’s obviously not the same thing in terms of injury, but the principle on level of blatant rule breaking is the same.  What the referee should have done in Suarez’s case in 2010 is to have given him a red card, and instead of a penalty for Ghana, have given Ghana the actual goal.  If players are encouraged to play goalie like Suarez, soon, there will be 4 players as goalie alongside the goalie in a defining moment on any given match.  Absolutely stupid.",Against
"Karma is a bitch.  Suarez stole the match against Ghana with a purposeful handball in 2010, and now, Ghana sees them out the door in 2022.  Maybe you should’ve bitten more players Suarez.",Against

Was sent off right away and ghana had a penalty. There's nothing more you could ask from the refs. Now, if it was ethical or not. That's up for debate. Fair win, yes. It was a tradeoff between goal and suarez.",Against

That’s a 5g tower if u look hard enough not a ball,Against
I hate watching this cause Suarez did the right thing. Otherwise Ghana go through with an offside goal which wouldnt of been allowed with ccurrent VAR but they didn't have it back then. This is nothing more than a freekick to Uruguay but the heat of the moment and circumstances dictate that no one looks for it except the handball from SUarez.,Against

Not Suarez fault, he already payed his price by Ghana getting a penalty, not his fault, the penalty tackers fault! And besides, they never deserved the free kick, he tripped himself up!!!

I find the comments here amazing........people so stubbornly cling to the desire to paint this loss of Ghana as unjust because of dislike for Suarez.   This video clearly shows that free kick awarded to Ghana was WRONG......the player dived!  Yes dived!!!  Then Suarez bats it off the line and is red carded........what?  The Ghana player who dived is the hero?  Please people take the blinders off!  Suarez was red carded accordingly but if that ball had gone in from the free kick that would have been the injustice.  The following missed penalty was irrelevant when you correctly consider what took place prior to that handball.,Against

"I think in such cases the referee should award the goal and red card to the handplayer..because you stop a goal and move the situation to penalty and that is a different context and with a different psychology and pressure.

"One of the biggest injustices in football in my lifetime. It shouldn't be the case that a player can stop a certain goal with their hand knowing the other team will then only have a 75% chance of a goal from a penalty. 

The ref should have the power to award the goal when a certain goal is stopped intentionally in that way. I still feel for Ghana, especially as it was the African World cup and they were the last African team left in the tournament.",Against
I remb watching Suarez stop the ball with his hands .my mother cried after Ghana lost..The gods of Africa will never forgive Suarez .🇰🇪🇰🇪,Against
"What the did was part of the game.  Getting a red card and a penalty kick  were also part of the game.  Ghana's player did not score on the penalty kick wasn't what Ghana team wanted. The game must went on.  Of course, at the end of the day there will be a winner and a loser. The loser just happened to be Ghana's team. It's just a game.",Neutral

"I come by this video 8 year later, and find that theres is a lot of people commenting football who don't know the rules of the game or the history. In football the objective is to score goals and to stop the opponent team on scoring. When you use a last resourse, tackel or hand, in modern football you get a red card, and if inside the penalty box, you get a penalty kick. This rule is from the 80s, before you could handball like Suarez and there was no red card. Look for Mario Kempes against Poland in 1978. Football is a sport, it has rules. It's not a contest of some kind of ""morality"" and ""ethics"" that a group of people, according to their own sensibility, rate as ""good"" or ""bad"". Save that for crimes on humanity, like wars. Try to see football as a sport, because looking it as something else is very complicated. Cheers",Favor

SUAREZ's Hand,however,
He saw RedCard and the penalty was given and kicked(missed by Assamoah Gyan)
Plus, what Suarez did was nothing new: 1978 Mario Kempes hand's saved Argentina from a Polland's Goal(penalty kicked and missed)...The difference: he wasn't expulsed and kept playing and even scored the winning goal for Argentina!!!
Neither was expulsed a spanish defender who handballed a clear uruguayan goal in WC1990
(The penalty was kicked and missed by Ruben Sosa and in Uruguay we all blamed him...nobody called the spanish cheater)...
SO ONLY LUIS SAW RED CARD(He couldn't play against Holland in SemiFinals)but he wouldn't had have to put his hand if that freekick of last minute wasn't given for an unexistent foul(ghanese player Adiya let himself fall alone without Fuccile even toucheing him)...SO AFTER 8 YEARS JUST STOP CRYING...EVERYTHING WAS REGLAMENTARY",Favor

Watch the replay, his teammate is trying to play Goalie too, because he knows it's there only hope in that position.

"While it may be true that a number of players would have done the same thing in his situation what really annoys me is his reaction when Ghana miss the resulting penalty there’s just no need for that.
Also I think the rule should be changed as the ball is clearly going in if Suarez doesn’t handle it so a goal should be given and maybe just a yellow card to Suarez so no double punishment because if it’s a red card and then the team misses the penalty, like Ghana did, then there’s no justice because Suarez being sent off right at the end of extra time is no disadvantage to Uruguay",Against

"Everyone will be do the same thing, only unfair thing is Suarez reaction after Ghana miss the penalty.",Against
"Luis Suarez is a dirty, immature player whose attitude reflects very poorly on both himself, his country, and the game.

That being said, Suarez didn't cheat. Sure, it was ""wrong,"" but it was an impulsive reaction of reasonable proportions. Remember that this was near the end of overtime and any goal would've been good as gold. I think every player would be under a lot of stress to do whatever they could possibly do to win. Again, it's not right, but in the heat of the moment, you do the dumbest of things and you don't even realize what you're doing until you suffer the consequences of those actions.

What really irks me about Suarez is how he labeled himself a ""hero"" after the match. He wasn't. He screwed his own team over. Had Ghana converted that penalty, the narrative would be completely different today. Suarez would've been seen as a goat and rightfully so. It would've been a mistake he'd never be able to live down. Not to mention the red card made him unavailable for the semi-final, so, even in victory, there was a very stiff price that had to be paid for being a ""hero."" Given Uruguay lost both the semi-final and the third-place match, I'd say it wasn't worth it.",Against

Suarez knew that denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by handling was a sending off offence, he did it, and was sent off. Ghana should have made the penalty. He is right, any player should have done the same. He bought his team one more chance at the cost of a red card, and he paid it. Plain and simple.",Favor
"how is it cheating? he handballed the ball, so he was sent off. action and punishment. it was the last moments of the extra time, of course he would do it. everyone would do it.! he sacrificed himself playing a semifinal for his teammates and his country. for me, thats the ultimate act of loving your nation as far as football is involved. and from a player that is infamous for his unsportsmanship actions.",Against
how to stop africa ? By cheating ...,Against
"I would say this isn't cheating and more a professional foul. Cheating is braking the rules and getting away with it. Suarez cheated and, inevitably, got punished. I think people find it controversial as it was this that stopped the last African team from going through and Suarez is linked with racism, but there isn't a person in the world who can say they wouldn't have done it, because if they didn't they would be being stupid.",Against

Suarez is the man those who are saying him cheat what would have they done if they were in his place for your country its world cup bro,Against
"Who said ""crime"" doesn't pay?
This is one example that sometimes it does.
Had Ghana scored that goal, they would have been in the SF, not uruguay.
However, it's understandable that he did it, his colleague besides him, Fucile, also tried to put his hand to the ball 0:19 and 0:26 and most players would, at least out of instinct due to the pressure and enormity of the moment.",Against
This was a horrible moment in world cup history. Cheating that Ghana had no control over. Ghana had won that game and if it weren't for Suarez they would have gone far in the world cup. Ghana had already scored and was blocked by a handball to make them miss a goal. They missed the penalty and it's their fault for that but it's Suarez's fault they lost that game. It was not smart or strategic it was cheating and it doesn't matter if Suarez didn't want to do it or if it was on purpose. Uruguay 100 percent cheated and it was in the hands of Suarez. For him to celebrate the miss of Ghana ' s penalty is disrespectful and shows his real self. He likes to cheat and likes to bite people. End of Story.,Against

Apologize? Why tho? Besides the ghanan player missing the penalty and the tactical foul the freekick that chained all this was a dive. Plus offside on the freekick. Wtf are people complaining about?

& he didn’t want to shake Evra’s hand he has a thing against the black people 😂🫱🏽‍🫲🏿,Against
"He is right, and the Maradona comparisons are off base. Cheating is doing something outside the rules, like scoring a goal with your hand and pretending you did it with your head. Suarez made a tactical decision, traded a red card and a penalty for a goal. No different that pulling the shirt of a player who gets away. If the Ghana player scored everyone would be saying what a fool, leaving his teammates with 10 players. It worked. Stop being crybabies.",Favor
What is he even saying? Terrible English,Against
The ball went past the line,Against
"Suarez is 100% right, I don’t get it why people made a big deal of this.",Favor
Ball don lie he didn't do anything wrong,Against
"My dear it's not your fault, a foul was committed in the 18yd box and penalty was given I think that's settles it all. What if Gyan scored will there be need for this interview?",Neutral
It's unsportsmanlike. He did get punished. It does align with his playing style though.  I wouldn't expect him to apologize.,Against
It's an exploit to the rules players do everything to win.,Against
"Nor should he apologize. Suarez is a douche, but during the Ghana game he made the right call and saved his team. I was rooting for Ghana, but the hate Suarez got for that is dumb. Hate him for the things actually worth hating on.",Against
That's why you always crying,Against
This man is a disgrace. Regardless of how good of a football player he is.. he is a garbage of a human being,Against
He is exactly right... He got a red card. He got what he deserved. It wasn't like he walked away without a red card.,Favor
Suarez is definitively against fair play. A red car signifies unfair play and doesn’t erase the action itself and he should definitely apologize.,Against
"""It's not my fault because I don't miss the penalty"" now that's my goat Suarez",Against
I’ll do it too to be honest even though I am all for Ghana and the African continent.,Against
Maradona: hell yeah brother,Favor
Once again it is proved that the only way to succeed is by being a cheater and violent 😢,Against

I WILL DO THAT FOR MY COUNTRY... I GOT PUNISHMENT...  I GOT RED CARD PLUS GHANA GOT PENALTY... NOW... FOR A BIG MOMENT... YOUR OPPORTUNITY... YOU BIGGEST MOMENT ... TO QUALIFY TO THE NEXT ROUND... YOU NEED TO SCORE A PENALTY AND ADVANCED TO THE NEXT STAGE... YOU SCORE THE PENALTY ???,Favor
I'd do the same for England and wouldn't be apologising,Against
"There is nothing to apologise.
He got a red card for handling the ball.
Ghana couldn't capitalise...it is as simple as that..
So many players conduct deliberate fouls in the penalty area in the rush of the game..
This was at the peak of adrenaline rush",Neutral
If it was Jorge Fucile that saved (the other defender on the line who also tried handballing it) most people probably wouldn't blame him it's just cuz people don't like suarez,Against
Can never ever doubt the competitiveness of Luis Suarez,Favor
"I think people with a winning mentality who knows what is at stake in football would’ve done exactly the same even though it might be dirty or unfair.

It’s like the last defender vs a striker all alone making the tackle and grabbing a red card for it.

He did what had to be done, gave his country a chance for what would’ve been a definite goal and it paid off.",Favor
"Uruguayan players will do anything for their country , that’s why they are KNOWN AS LA GARRA CHARUA",Favor
Karma is a bitch isn't it?,Neutral
bro got humbled,Against
The first time a Spanish player speaks English,Against
I agree with him he got his punishment and ghana still missed,Favor
"I don't understand why Ghana was salty after the handball,it's not Suarez fault Asamoah missed",Against
Its kinda smart what he did,Neutral
"I don’t know why everyone’s mad at him. Tactical fouls are within the confines of the game. All the time player have the choice between committing a foul or letting things play out in a way very likely to result in a goal. It’s within the confines of the game. Calling it cheating is crazy, he didn’t try to get away with something nefarious he just chose the foul over the goal. With that said in a scenario like this where it’s not a likely goal, but a certain goal I see no reason why the rules shouldn’t be changed to allow the official to award the goal.",Neutral
no need to apologize...,Neutral
"Why should Suarez apologize ? 
I don't understand you people.
It's like saying Henry should have told the referee he touched the ball with his hand against Ireland. 

You do anything so your team wins, if you cheating is not punished it's the ref fault only. 
If the ref santion you with a red and a penalty and you still win then shame on the looser.",Against
Good that he cried after the Ghana match 2022,Favor
This is why we Ghanaians don't like Suarez,Against
"fifa should change the rules in situationsl ike this give goal and red card, not penalty and red card",Against
It’s not really something he should apologize for but I get why people would be upset especially after the way he acted when gyan missed that pen 😂💀,Against
I love how he talks,Favor
"Just to point this out, Ghana still had a chance to score. Handball sure, take the red and get out, you had the penalty and missed. Not like Suarez had wizard powers to send the ball sailing.",Against
He shouldn’t anyway.,Against
He is right,Favor
"If Maradona didn't apologize for his ""hand of god"" goal, Suarez has no job apologizing here",Against

"Tu mérite pas ta place
La fifa devait t'exclure du foot à vie",Against
I mean this was in the 120 minute and if ghana were to score they would have move on to the semi final as the score was 1-1 at the time.,Neutral
"And he shouldn't, it would be pathetic if he actually apologized. People that think he should apologize need to stop watching sports for the good of the universe",Against
"He gave Ghana a free PK, a chance to win and they missed it",Against
I love him,Favor
"This wasnt any different than a tactical foul in the penalty area he did what he did got a red card ,Ghana got a penalty all by the book, not his fault they missed",Against
Lol Suarez is the most lovable villain in the world,Favor
I even do that for my country.. poor ghana missed a penalty and make suarez full responsibility of that penalty shot wtf,Against
KARMA EATING ARROGANCE,Against

This was a normal reflection,Neutral
Can someone translate this to me i cant understand what this man said,Neutral
At least he didn't bit him.,Neutral
"Thats stupid to ask him if he would apologise. Apologise to whom? İ was mad myself, because i wanted ghana to win. But he simply made his country advance to next round with that move.",Against
"He's right, though.",Favor
WC 2022 Ghana made the best revange against Uruguay and specially against Suarez 💪💪,Against
"He is 100% right. He didnt cheat, he got red card. Everything was with the rules. Ghana had penalty which simply missed. Suarez did what he was supposed to do - help his team to get to another game. It may not be the best way to get promotion but still 100% with rules.",Favor
"What a stupendous argument. If he didn’t handball it the ball would have went straight into the back of the net which would have resulted in a 2-1 score, not risking the chance of missing a penalty. Bearing in mind it was the last seconds of the game, if the 2-1 goal was scored and suarez didn’t hand ball it, the full time whistle would have blown and the final score would have been 2-1 to Ghana, sending them through to the semi finals. Nice try though 😂",Against
i would do the same thing smart player lmao not his fault,Neutral
And look what happened against Ghana this time... Karma's a bitch eh Luis?! 🤣,Against
Man he a savage he is the real MVP😂😂😂 they’ve already punished him with a red car and ejection…. Now the Gyan player missing the penalty is another story…. I remember vividly that Ghana players were extremely happy about that penalty and Uruguayans were devastated but hold your horses then Ghana players missed and the coin out of nowhere flipped! And on top of that they didn’t score their penalties stop that’s not Luis Suarez fault !,Against
He's right,Favor
"He got Ghanaians from"" It's been 10 years maybe let's move on"" to "" I got murder in my mind"" 🤣",Against
"Vamos!!
Same history second time Ghana2022 miss free penalty ,, karma forever",Favor
"Lmao. Suarez's whole career despite no matter what he's done is far bigger and miles ahead of Ghana national footballing chumps and any Ghanaian player. 
He broke the rule, but got the red for it. End of story (1-1 = 0) If he apologizes he'd add another 1 but nothing to balance it out as he's already taken his punishment via red card. Y'all just too sensitive for others",Against
They should change the rules to where the referee can just award goals in situations like this,Against
"And karma got him now, he was crying like a baby",Against
"He cheated , simple as that",Against
And karma hit ya last Friday. Seeing you cry was sooo satisfying. I’m enjoying drinking your tears.,Against

Bravo ! Por que pedir disculpas? El cometió la falta y se hizo cargo. Creo que no muchos jugadores harían lo mismo por su país Mil veces Gracias Luis 💪❤,Favor

"Foul shouldn't be a tactic that someone can use in exchange of his penalty. Penalty means: ""YOU DID UNDESIRABLE THINGS IN THE GAME."" Penalty cannot indulge someone's misbehavior. Everyone could have unconsciously made the same choice as his in desperate situation. But, he should have apologized for his foul not only to ghanaian but to his fans as a top star player.",Against
He gave power to Ghana so that they never gave up the game for this,Favor
Why should he apologize though? 😹😹,Against
He missed the round of 16 tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤮🤮😂🤮,Against
What you guys don’t understand is Ghanaians aren’t angry to the point of violence. It’s just cruise rivalry. If Suarez was to come to Ghana he will be hailed. It isn’t that deep,Neutral

"Why should he apologise though? Yeah its playing unfair, but he got his punishment for it and it was to help his nation",Against
That was so freakin funny dude. He celebrated when Ghana missed the penalty too😂,Favor
Suarez made a great point about considering an apology had he injured an opponent with a tactical foul. But in this case he caused no physical harm. He made a tactical handball. Anyone smart would have done the same for their country,Favor
Why should he apologize for a tactical handball? Lmfao,Against

The most painful moment in African football,Against
Lmao I hate that lady and the media in general. Trying to get reactions on purpose,Against
"Don't hate the player , hate on the stupid rules , ""intelligent fouls"" like this are wrong on all levels. It's litteraly charging the course of the game. Red card+ penalty isn't ennough to punish this... It was a goal 100% without the handball but now it's a 80% goal chance with penalty. Having 1 player down for 10 minutes is way more advantagous then having 1extra goal to score....",Against
Suarez was absolutely right and Gyan also understood as he gave intelligent answer. It's the brainless fans who are too immature to understand.,Against
Saurez the dirtiest player in the world,Against
"When Africa finally wins a WC, this will be a HUGE part of that story.",Favor
"Wait until an african player does the same thing. The rules will change. fifa don't really want an african team winning the world cup, my opinion",Against
In my eyes he’s a cheat. The moment you start learning how to play football your coach tells you that you can’t do a handball unless you are a goalie but he wasn’t which means you cheated the game and that you are a cheater 🤷🏾‍♂️,Against
Maturity my guy,Neutral
Cheating is cheating. I hate cheaters,Against
Asamoah Gyan to me you are mad. Where is the fairplay FIFA always preaches?? Anyone who supports Suarez in this act is a cheat and i dont expect that person to even criticise anything wrong a player does or even a referee because you will NOT be playing according to the rules of the game which is WRONG FULL STOP,Against

Suarez doesn’t need to apologize to no one.   You clearly heard the man would do the same if he was in Suarez shoes.  I think all of us would do the same to save the country we play for.,Favor

You are a true legend!! Very responsible response.,Favor
This is how sick society has become. It's just like saying one should not show remorse just because he's been punished. Looks like you all miss the point for the apology,Against
"You not ""We"". Take responsibility asamoah",Against

Ghana just missed a penalty 😂,Against
I would've done the same,Favor
If i was suarez i wouldve made that save too.,Against

Yeah GOD have 2 Hands 😂,Neutral

No. Why should his handball be cheating? He stopped the goal and got a red. Its not cheating. Grow up",Against

I compared the situation to the goaltending rule in basketball, in which the basket is awarded because you know the ball was going in. I have since become much more knowledgeable of the game of football, and come to appreciate what Suarez did, and that was give his team one last chance to win the match, which they did. The Ghanaian player had the PK to win and he missed it, so it's on him. In the end, well played, Uruguay!",Favor

This is an example how the rules in football need changing. I don’t think anyone did wrong here Suarez broke rules to put his team in semi final if the rules prevented that happening it wouldn’t of happened. It was last seconds of extra time with the score level the ball was going to be in the net 100% certain unless someone stopped it so what would any player do stop it with a hand and risk being sent off and giving a penalty away or just let other team win? Referees should be allowed to award goals to teams instead of penalties in cases like this.,Against

Or are the fouls that are committed in the areas a homage to football, or are they mere accidents of innocent and pure players? Are they faults that seek to honor this sport? A good kick, a good push, a trip, a nudge, a header ... Does not this happen every day? Maybe, you could say, they are more hypocritical faults, they seek to disguise themselves more, to disguise themselves a little ... Suarez played the ball shamelessly, like a child who still enjoys the game of football in the street with his friends. Their catch brings the freshness of this sport, without so much money or corruption (that's corruption!) Of the men of FIFA, or political correctness, or people who are self-sacrificing ... Is it a crime, should they go to jail, Is it immoral? No. It is a fault that is paid with the expulsion. Justice has been done? Yes. Uruguay was sanctioned? Yes, he lost this great player. Suarez was quick, intelligent, bold. Others are asleep, and while they resolve what to do, they were swallowed by History. How many Puritan comments!",Against

"Forget about debates on Suarez for 1 sec and just conclude that Uruguay did not get a fully commendable win  then. 
Is it cheating?
No! It's by football rule a foul and the Ref did absolutely the right thing.  Red+Penalty. (Also, if you know what type of player Suarez is, it not too hard to conclude anyway)
Is it commendable?
Depending on your stands whether winning is everything or abiding by sportsmanship is more important. Anyone who plays football knows you COULD foul to delay or hold up attacks and depending  on the scoring chance the opponent have, your foul gets punishments. This is also why after this match many people suggest FIFA to add more severe punishment to fouls alike Suarez's but the problem being for a single player during a match, you cannot surpass a red card punishment, even against such a decisive and unprecedented foul.
About the what ifs
You just can't make what ifs in football matches. Sure, what if Ghana scored another goal before this? What if Suarez did not hand-ball? What if Gyan scored the Penalty? A single moment like this can just decide the matches outcomes and, like it or not, this is also what makes football so popular worldwide in the first place. Year later now we see football matches being fairer (VR video referees) and less referee mistakes (Lampard's denied goal and such alike)are made in general. This trend is what makes football, the sport and matches themselves more enjoyable.",Favor

This is an example of football rules needing changing. Ghana should have been through without doubt. It was the handball by Suárez that stopped them winning 100%. There is no way the ball wouldn’t of gone in goal had there been no hand ball no one can argue that. Yes ref got the decision right and did all he could to give Ghana a fair chance but seriously if there is ever a time where it is worth giving a penalty away this was it certain goal or likely goal every single player would go for the likely goal rather than certain goal against them.,Against

Plus Appiah for Ghana (shirt number 10) was offside after the ball was headed on after the freekick was taken, so if Ghana had scored it should have been disallowed for that anyway. And Uruguay had a stonewall penalty not awarded earlier in extra-time, after Paintsil fouled Abreu in the box.

So Uruguay deserved to go through, and Ghana had no right whatsoever to complain or feel robbed or hard done by.",Against

I have no respect for someone like this.. All that talent was wasted on a shitty human being, who stole one the greatest sporting moments in African football history.

SUAREZ's Hand,however,
He saw RedCard and the penalty was given and kicked(missed by Assamoah Gyan)
Plus, what Suarez did was nothing new: 1978 Mario Kempes hand's saved Argentina from a Polland's Goal(penalty kicked and missed)...The difference: he wasn't expulsed and kept playing and even scored the winning goal for Argentina!!!
Neither was expulsed a spanish defender who handballed a clear uruguayan goal in WC1990
(The penalty was kicked and missed by Ruben Sosa and in Uruguay we all blamed him...nobody called the spanish cheater)...
SO ONLY LUIS SAW RED CARD(He couldn't play against Holland in SemiFinals)but he wouldn't had have to put his hand if that freekick of last minute wasn't given for an unexistent foul(ghanese player Adiya let himself fall alone without Fuccile even toucheing him)...SO AFTER 8 YEARS JUST STOP CRYING...EVERYTHING WAS REGLAMENTARY",Against

You cannot see it in this highlight, but the free kick before Suarez block was not a foul at all! Of course FIFA wanted an African team in top 4, as they wanted Japan and Korea in 2002. But, you know, we uruguayans don't give a damn about that. We love to spoil others parties. Brazil's WC in 1950, Argentina's last Copas America in 1987 and 2011.

"The infamous Suarez handball.  This incident encapsulates Uruguayian international football perfectly.  
First instinct is to cheat............Not striving to play to your limits, within the rules.
It is only a natural instinct if you are dishonest.
Rules of game could easily put a stop to this.   Nowadays with VAR this goal could be awarded as it was definitely going in. Just need rules updating alongside technological assistance.    
Don't give oxygen to the cheats.
Thankfully, since 1986*  the World Cup has been won by the most deserving team.
'82 - Italy not the best  '78 Argentina were not going to lose. '74  - Dodgy ref favours hosts.
'70 - '62 and '58 * the obvious exceptions with Brasil. '66 England were lucky hosts.   - all other remaining World Cups '54 '50 '38 '34 '30 did not see the 'best' team winning.
So as the game modernises continually, one thing we may guarantee is that the 'best' team will win.  
If England is the home of football, then please remind yourself of the ethics and spirit of the game.   Love wins over hate,  and football, on the  ultimate stage of a World Cup Finals will uphold this.",Against

Suarez saved a goal in the last minute with his hands. Then they had the chance to win it by scoring that penalty in the 120th minute!! They didn't!

"ooooook, do not ever realy comment but I read through some of the comments and seems like people see Suarez's hand ball a ""tacktical/smart"" play.. people please, he is a disrespectful selfish   , unsportmanship type of player, yes he might score goals and might be a good player playing in barcelona, but he is also known to be most disrespectful player. thats something you don't do in footbal, you see I get a feeling lot of people don't get the full meaning of that sport, sportsmanship in soccer is a very big part of the game, also in all the other sports of course , but footbal or soccer is somewhat delicate in that sense, that's why when sneaky, disrespectcul, cheaters like suarez and materazzi, who also was ""smart/tactical"" play with real sportsmens like Zidane, they do not click  together and real players cannot take them and loose control, true footbal players don't cheat, the win and they take the lose like a man, they understand both parts of the game.  I also remeber watching that game I was so mad at suarez and sorry for Ghana cause Ghana was the better team, if you say suarez was smart by his actions because he kind of defended his country in a sense, what about people in Ghana who deserved to see their country play in the semifinals and who knows maybe even win the damn thing, also one more thing who remembers materazzi ? and who remembers Zidane,   now you tell me. and one more thing justice would be served if suarez was disqualified ,like maradona, for the 3rd ""accident"" of him biting another player, I mean are you f... kidding me ?",Against
I hate Uruguay,Against
The keepers realy sucked and in 2010 diego forlan was a beast,Against
"IDK where all that Ghana worshipping came from.They were in the same group as my country in that WC,and they were the only team that didn't scored from the game in that group.They've beaten Serbia after ridicilous penalty made by our player,drew with Australia again scoring from penalty and were unable to take the lead despite the fact that Australia had 10 men for like 80 minutes.They've losted from Germany too.So unlike some true heroic football teams like Mexico and especially Costa Rica from Brazil,Ghana was overrated.The luck they had so far turned their back on them and that's it.Suarez just did what every player who would die on the pitch for his country would do.",Against
And this is why people don't like Suarez,Against

Yes, they would've advanced with the draw anyway but it really must've shocked American players and it's always better to know you have to score a single goal then knowing you need two. This Uruguay-Ghana match was something like a payback. I like paybacks. Like Brazil got their own for stupid Fred diving against Croatia back in 2014 and the following semifinals' defeat 1-7 to Germany.

Suarez made an offense, one of  7 offenses that rquire a ""super"" red card:
Serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting at anyone, *deliberately touching the ball with a hand in order to prevent a goal or to deny an obvious goal scoring opportunity*, *fouling an opponent to prevent an obvious goal scoring opportunity (e.g., holding to stop a breakaway)*, using offensive (or insulting or threatening language and/or gestures) , or receiving a second yellow card in one game.

"According to the current rules, it's fair play, but I honestly feel that they should be able to review the tape and if a certain (100% likely) goal is prevented by a handball, the goal should just be awarded instead of a penalty. The point of a penalty is to model the uncertainty of what would happen if a player wasn't fouled, but in this case, there was no uncertainty. I mean, penalties are awarded for SO much less, so I believe there should be a better call for this situation.

Maybe Uruguay deserved the victory in penalties, but Ghana deserved to have ended the game before that.",Against

"Every World Cup throws up that unforgettable match you still remember years later, and this was no exception.  It was spine tingling watching it as a neutral so can't imagine how it must been if your country was involved.",Neutral
"Is it really unfair play? The handball was penalized, so he didnt break any rule. He got a red card and the penalty was awarded, so whats the problem. Besides, the free kick was wrongly awarded to Ghana since the player dived and dont forget how there were two players offside when the free kick was taken, thats unfair.",Against

Yes it was bad play and unsportsmanlike for suarez to celebrate after but if ghana scored the penalty this wouldn't have become a big deal. So can we all stop blaming suarez for this.",Against

Can you really blame Suarez? I mean honestly if your country relied on you would you take a red card for them? of course you would... Suarez took the risk of either Ghana scoring or him taking a red card and having a chance of his keeper saving a penalty.,Against

I'm not from Uruguay or Ghana, so I have no dog in this fight, but I can't hold it against Suarez, and I think you should all relax about Suarez.

Having said that, if you want to blame anybody for Ghana's misfortunes, blame soccer and it's rules. Perhaps there should be some rule changes where plays like that cost 2 expulsions, or something more severe short of granted a goal.

I'm just saying, it's not Suarez's fault, nor his team.",Favor

"The handball would have never happened if the ref didn't call the foul to set it all up, the Ghana player fell by himself with no one near him yet the ref still called it so maybe if the ref didn't call that free kick which clearly wasn't a free kick than the handball would have never happened",Against
"That handball was smart of Suarez. It was the final minutes, the ball was destined for the back of the net anyway as he couldn't have got to it with his head. If he gives them a penalty they have a 50% chance of scoring where as the shot he saved was definitely a goal. It's not like he wasn't punished for it so what's the big deal?",Favor
"It's just stupid people are hating on Suarez on the fact he did get sent of by saving the ball. I know there is a lot of hate when it comes to him and his teeth and because he acted like a hero. Suarez is imo the best striker in the world and one of the best clinical finishers, in the wc he almost carried Uruguay. I can't understand why people hate on him for this match. Because of Suarez his red card they managed to make it a round further in the wc if he wouldn't have done this they were out.

Sometimes I'm not thinking and just hit it in the air or sometimes I just react in the heat of the moment... Alex oxlame chamberlain did it against Chelsea... It happens.. What ever the case...

"As an Uruguayan, i gotta say i will be mad if Ghana do that.... but  i will accept the fact that Suarez was sent off and a penalty was given. If Uruguay missed that penalty i will be mad with MY player... in this case, assamoah gyan. Ghana had his chance... and a double chance in penalties kicks. they missed. NOW is their own fault the loss... and  there is a huge difference between cheating and an ilegal foul, its not like Suarez was playing on drugs or the referee didnt give the penalty.... BY THE WAY... there was no foul in the previous action if you remember...",Against
Even tho it was wrong to handball the ball. Dont tell me you wouldn't do that if your team had a chance to pass to the semis of any competition specially the world cup. To be fair ghana had a penalty and they missed. They should've took their chances and they didn't ,Against

A. With the ball coming that fast, if you were suarez and wanted to get a head on it it would be hard not to get a hand on it.
B. If Suarez hadn't handballed it was a guaranteed goal, so drawing a penalty means Ghana would still have to score again, and the risk payed off.

If he hadn't blocked it somehow Uruguay definitely would of lost. This gave them a better chance, and look at how things ended up going.  I'm not defending the handball though, that is every bit wrong and should be a red card.",Favor

"i dont want to be patronising but i think someone needs to explain to casual football fans the difference between cheating and professional fouling. cheating is when u trick someone, proffessional fouling is when u choose to comit a crime knowing u will be punished accoridingly! suarez sacrificed his life in the game and gave a penalty away knowing what would happen! everything that happened here was fair accoring to fifa rules. proffesional fouling is a part of many sports at all levels and is tought and encouraged by coaches it is not cheating!!!!! please observe the difference!!! ",Against

   penalty, never complaint to the spanish player. We where sad for Ruben Sosa who missed the penalty.
- 1966 World cup, England vs Portugal semifinal, Charles Charlton handball saves a Portugal goal in the line, penalty scored.
- 2008 Premier league, Liverpool vs Everton: handball of Everton saves a goal in the line, Not sure if Liverpool scored.

These and many many more handballs are happening all the time today. Nobody complains...but on Suarez handball yes you complain???",Against

I don't understand what the fuzz is about.  As a player you are supposed to stop the ball before goes into the net. Particularly if it is the last minute.  If you use your hands the other team gets a PK and you get expelled. That is the rule. In the old days you didn't get expelled and you did it all the time. ,Neutral

"People hate Suarez for this moment. I don't understand why, he put his hands up and saved his team from going out. The ref gave a penalty, which is good enough and because he didn't score, people despise Suarez. Look at Oxlade-Chamberlains handball, got a red card, penalty and scored and people still like him and he's not seen as a cheating cunt, and he made a way crazier handball save than Suarez.

What a cheat!  Suarez knew what he was doing-he stopped Ghana from definitely going through and reduced their chances to 50/50 by bringing about a penalty situation.  Ghana should have gone through.  Perhaps with this latest biting incident Fifa could ban him from the world cup-now that would be Karma.,Against

you could actually hear gyan's heart being ripped in two...,Against
"Its funny how people forget the circumstances that led to the whole Suarez handball.

1. The phantom foul (ie. A dive by the Ghana player with no player within 1m of him)

2. The 3 offsides before the final handball.

In all honesty Ghana got what it deserved had they actually been 'robbed' then you could feel sorry for them. 

Suarez just did what any player would have done in that circumstance, make a sacrifice for the team.",Favor

"Everyone is bitching about Suarez, but the guy right infront of him was trying to do exactly the same. Their coach probally told them to do that if there would be a moment for that, so it probally wasn't even just Suarez being crazy.

"this had to be the most memorable match i have ever seen. i was on the edge of my sofa the whole time. I think one of the reasons it was so memorable was because this was the first time the World Cup had been held in Africa and by this point all the other african teams had been knocked out. GHANA was left standing, they  literally had the hopes of the whole African continent on their shoulders. I thought it was beautiful because the African people of all countries came together to support their last hope  Ghana.  all of Africas history, culture, pride and everything it meant to be African was on the line in a way. on the surface a simple soccer game to most but underneath it meant so much more for Africans....to see them get out in such a close game was soo sad and heartbreaking.  Will never forget that match ... props to uruguay aswell",Favor
"Really funny that people accuse Suarez of cheating. Every action in that sequence was going exact according to the fifa's rules. It was a foul and he was punished accordingly. Saying he cheated is the same like saying, for example, Ramos cheats because he makes a random foul. Ever since this moment i've admired Suarez. Say about the man what you want, but his hunger for succes in unquestionable.

Also notice the other uruguyan reaching with his hand. Lovely stuff imo. The absolute will to progress.",Favor

"As a sports fan who just got into football, Suarez took a risk but it was the right one to take. If he didn't stick his hand out, Uruguay was almost guaranteed to lose. With a penalty kick, Ghana would have to make the shot. 

This type of strategy is used all the time in basketball. Prevent an easy two point tying shot if you are up by two points by fouling the shooter. This forces the shooter to make each of the two free throws...",Favor

Not only that, Ghana were given the opportunity to score and win the game by being awarded a penalty. And you also have to think about the position Suarez was in. I mean, imagine that you're in the World Cup Quarter Finals with your country, with hardly any time left on the clock, and your team is about to concede a goal, which will all but eliminate you from the World Cup.

They went from 100 percent having a goal to 80-90 percent having a goal. Because we all know penalties are sometimes missed. That's why I think the rules should change.

Ghana got a chance and they missed it. That's it. And Uruguay deserved it. All South America was supporting Uruguay, of course, and they also played an amazing match against Germany. 
Uruguay won so stop crying.

"For people talking about ""fair play"", where's the ""fair play"" from the officiating crew? Throughout the game they clearly ripped off Uruguay, calling at least 10 non existent fouls in favor of Ghana. The cherry on top of the cake was the foul that is called at the last minute, from where the free kick that led to the Suarez incident occurs, there's video evidence that without the shadow of a doubt there's a about a 1.5 meter distance between the players, so how did he get fouled? Telekinesis?",Against

Why was it such a big deal that he celebrated Gyan missing? HIS COUNTRY STILL GOT TO PLAY IN THE WORLD CUP FFS,Against
How was it fair. Ball past the keeper and beat the two defenders on the goal line. The only way it wasn't a goal was that Suarez stuck his arm up to deflect the ball. If he hadn't cheated it was a sure goal. Then  fair punishment is to give a chance for a goal and send Suarez off. This is hardly fair. I would rather have a goal then a player sent off and a penalty.,Against

You can call it cheating but he can vouch for it.,Favor
He got punished. He lost his place in the semifinals and possibly the final of the world cup. he did it for his country and there's no rule against it.

yes but suarez purposefully handballed to stop the ball. If he didn't it would've gone in. Whether Ghana got a penalty after doesn't matter because penalties are not a guaranteed goal. Suarez broke the rules and stopped a guaranteed goal.,Against

You have to remember this is impulsive. There is no planning. You react without time to think. Like driving and an animal steps in front of your car and there people who will be in danger if you swerve to miss it. The correct reaction is to hit the animal but your immediate reaction is likely to be swerving to miss the collision. There is no time to think you just react. It doesn’t change the fact that Suarez was more dangerous and evil than count Dracula 😃,Against

"What the fuck you people are talking llabout. Every player will do the same thing it's a WC n they r all fighting to win. Whatever it take, some thing is batter than nothing. It was in the last minute on the clock n Suarez know that if he don't do that than its over so he took the risks  n push out before the ball was go in. So why the the fuck that can be awarded as a goals, until the ball was go in than their is no way the refree will awarded as a goal....  N Suarez know that because if he din't do that than they will gonna lost m they will be eliminate from the tournament which is y Suarez did that n he know if he did that than out of 100% they have 5% which is worth for something. N Suarez was sent off n left in tears,  n Ghana was awarded penalty also all the Ghana player are celebrate before the penalty, they don't complain to awarded as a goal how ever the Ghana player step in n take the penalty n they miss the penalty.. it wasn't Suarez fault after that Ghana still have a chave to win the match if they r really strong enough, they still have to soot out penalty but the Ghana player miss 3 penalties including the last minute penalty. The refree did the right things. Suarez is not the only 1 who did that it happen a lot in football. I think you people don't know about football or watch football, if the player was handball  inside the box it will  be  awarded a penalty n their will not be red card or yellow card because the player din't do on purposly. N if the player did purposely than it will b a red card n awarded a penalty. Thats that the gact",Favor

"It really wasn't cheating. He made an illegal play and got the punishment he deserved an ejection suspension and a pk for Ghana. Not his fault Ghana couldn't convert the pk. If given the opportunity to let the other team score a sure goal or having there being a chance it won't go in, everyone would chose the latter.",Favor
"i don't understand how people talk about injustice SMH like wtf... okay yeah Suarez saved the goal with his hand, but the ref called penalty and Suarez got sent off. Where is the injustice? A different story is that nigga missed the penalty. Its nobody's fault but his. He aint got enough balls to take a last minute penalty. Too bad for him, but don't blame it on Suarez. He is a hero to his country.",Against
"Yeah Suarez cheated but he got a red card and he paid for it, if Ghana scored, nobody would try to take shots at suarez as a villian, in fact Africa would be thanking him and everyone else would just call him an idiot for doing a handball. Ghana choked....nuff said  ",Against

"I don't agree with him. Blocking a goal by fieldplayer's hand is not allowed in football. Getting a penalty for that can't be perfect excuse. I think he recognized that his blocking at latest playtime of the game was a very small penalty compared to the consequences it would bring. He had to quit the stadium, but playtime is already over so it is not that critical, and it was Ghana's last perfect chance to win. But due to his dirty blocking they got additional unnecessary process to get the win, and unfortunately they failed. Of course, you can't always win like a gentleman. However, we generally do not recognize such play as a legitimate sport, so we hope him to be ashamed of the situation of deliberately breaking the rules for victory. He will be praised by the whole nation for giving everything for your country, but fair sports have been ruined for Uruguay's such victory.",Against
He's amerindian they are pretty stubborn.,Against
Honestly 100% fair and accurate.,Neutral
What did we expect from this piece of scum lol,Against
Gyan was to be blamed not Suarez,Against
"People have something against we Suarez in general… Other players do this and no one complained before.  For example...the tables were turned back in 1966 WC when Karl Heinz Schnellinger (West Germany) v Uruguay stopped a Uruguayan shot right on the goal line (a certain goal in the same way, as Ghana in 2010) yet no one remembers this guy, no one complains about this… Only about Suarez. You never heard Maradona, apologizing for his ""hand of God"" that resulted in a goal beating England and eliminating them from the World Cup in 1986… The punishment in the rules for handball is a penalty (if it’s in the box), those are the rules, Suarez didn’t write them, FIFA did, he just plays the game, like anyone else.  If it was your team, and you could stop the ball by sticking your hand out (unless you don’t care about your team advancing), you would be doing the EXACT same thing.  For that he’s a national hero in Uruguay. It should be also noted that he missed the following match against Netherlands, because of this handball/Red card, and Uruguay were beat by one goal, up until then Suarez has scored in every match, except the first one at that World Cup, so it’s reasonable to expect that had Suarez not been caught & given the red card, Uruguay would’ve likely at least tied the Netherlands in the next game & possibly gone to the WC Final.  It should also be noted, and you can many see many YouTube videos analyzing the play leading up tot he handball, all the clips show from that the free kick leading to the handball had multiple Ghana players in offside position, so, if you really want to see who got the unfair end of the stick...ask why didn’t the lie men call the multiple players off sides? If they did then the handball would have been after - and a free kick for Uruguay.  On top of that the foul that was called on Uruguay that led to the free kick was BS..the Ghana player tripped on himself - the Uruguayan defender was 10 feet from the guy...the entire thing should have never happened.  There were 2 missed calls by the refs right before the handball.",Against
With VAR that play had not been a foul and when they threw the center there were 2 offside. (watch the game again). Who robbed who? apologize to Uruguay,Against
He's right!,Favor
"Honestly, even before watching this video, I would defend him. I understand why Ghanaian fans are angry because they would have been through if it weren't for the handball. Why does everyone else hate him? He didn't cheat. He handballed and got his punishment by getting a red card and getting sent off. He didn't tell Gyan to miss the penalty",Favor
"As much as I hate him, he's absolutely right.",Against
He prevented a clear goal. I still get it because he did what he did for his nation but you can't justify it XD,Against
"You expect an apology from Luis ""Dahmer"" Suarez? Good luck.",Against
"Nah disagree, the penalty had 50/50 chance but that handball iirc prevented a clear goal!",Against
He has a point tho .ultimately he was punished for the handball and Ghana was rewarded penalty which they missed. Sounds fair,Neutral
"You need character and soul to apologize. So of course he doesn't apologize. 💀 Uruguay didn't win by fairness that day but by cheating. This is not sports! This is not the spirit of sports! This is not the spirit of sportsmanship! Of course Luis Suarez doesn't apologize. You need to have a sense for sportsmanship, fairness, the spirit of sports to apologize, you need to have character and soul! 💀",Against
