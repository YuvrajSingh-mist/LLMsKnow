Suarez saving a certain goal like a keeper - he could well be a GK but the save sent him off and led Ghana to a penalty.,Favor
It was painful I am sure for the Ghana fabs but I must say that if they had the same opportunity at that point of time they too would have utilised it. The end justifies the means.,Favor
