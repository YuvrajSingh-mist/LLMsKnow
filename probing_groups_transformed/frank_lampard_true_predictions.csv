They don't think

What a disgrace this Manuel is,Favor
"Could had been one of the greatest games of all time but ref decided, no….",Favor
"Bro, that was a pure goal!!!
IDK what the VARs do? They probably just sit there and play PUBG

"This was way more a clear cut decision that the final of 1966. In that case, I can see how it was a hard thing to judge.

This goal from Lampard in 2010 was not at all hard. It's just a normal fotball goal rhat was never allowed",Favor
"I am German and for the love of the game: This was a f....ng joke that this goal was disallowed. On the other hand: Revenge for our stolen title in 1966 tastes best served cold 🙂 

But again: One of the biggest mistakes in soccer history.

On a funny note: Why is it always England being involved in World Cup's biggest mistakes

1966 - Wembley Goal (England - Germany)
1986 - The Hand of God (England - Argentina)
2010 - Lampard No Goal (England - Germany)",Favor
The worst refereeing decision in history,Favor
Worst decision I've ever seen by a ref in an elite level game,Favor
"Geoff Hurst's ""ghost"" winning goal in 1966 have to be paid.

1970 losing the QF to Germany after leading 2-0
1990 losing the semi-final on penalties
2010 Lampard's goal not seen by the assistant referee

The curse started right after the final whistle of the 1966 World Cup Final.",Favor
"Tonight lads, is the night. Its fckn going nowhere but home this time. Three Lions on my shirt till I die!",Neutral
England’s 1966 World Cup winning goal (also versus Germany) was a goal given that did not cross the line. Consider it divine and comedic payback,Against
"Guess Germany must have fixed the ref, or is it just when things favour England that it must be fixing?",Favor
14 years of hurt,Favor
After the VAR decision of 2022 and 2024 I kinda miss these,Favor
wasn't a pen against holland last night. but that made up for this (if we win the euros),Favor
"Insane how relatively recent this was, only a few years later the possibility of this ever happening was completely stamped out of the game.",Favor
As such we now have goal line technology,Favor
Neuer would have seen that that was well over the line as well. So far over the line.,Favor
You don’t even need goal line technology to see that’s a goal. The only technology needed was the camera which the referee could’ve easily rewinded back. At the end of the day it was a Goal and should count towards Frank Lampard’s goals with England.,Favor
The goal that bought in the age of VAR...,Favor
That referee hase been fired afterwords i saw the documentary about it,Favor
Where is Var?,Favor
Standard of referee and linesmen ??,Favor
Mark Lawrenceson clown,Favor

It’s just a game little bro,Neutral
Watched it in Russia. Had only 1 thought. WHO HIRED A BLIND REFEREE???,Favor
Right so that it was disallowed,Favor
A different perspective on that incident;   https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lcV4SphySZc,Neutral
where is the russian linesman when you need him lol haha,Favor
Disgraceful decision that probably decided the match.,Favor
"Every person who officiated that match needs to go for reconciliation (confession in a Catholic Church).

They have to atone for it.

As Kenyan, I'm appalled at the brazen theft. To quote somebody, the Brits would say, WE WAS ROBBED!",Favor
"The biggest scam in the World Cup since Maradona’s handball, naturally",Favor
Sunday 26th June 2010,Neutral
Thank god we didn’t have VAR in those days.,Favor
Just like 2002 when USA scored against Germany and it was disallowed….,Neutral
Idiots who argue against VAR need to watch this video.,Favor
here after Lamine Yamal disallowed goal vs Real,Neutral
"I was 7 when I watched it live, can remember like it was yesterday absolute bullshit",Favor
Imagine if Germany scored from the counter attack that followed,Favor
The English referees in a club match robbed Lampard once when he thrashed a shot into the top left hand corner of the net only for it to bounce back out of the goal. No goal given. Great champion and team robbed again here.,Favor
"Well 1966 the goal was given because the assist referee was influenced by Hurst's reaction as he later admitted (it doesn't matter if the ball crossed the line or not), the swiss referee had not seen a goal and asked the assist.

Here is a similar situation, Neuer pretended that nothing happened and brought the ball very quick back into the game. The refs were influenced by this.

Reactions mattered in both games. The worst part is that in both cases the refs were absolutely useless. At least we have today technology and video proof to prevent situations like that as good as possible. But it boggles my mind that they still make mistakes despite having four referes on the field and 3 individuals that review the tv footage.",Favor
Give Lampard Ghost goal d'or,Favor
"14 years later, this was my first painfull football memory as a kid. Im 23 now and it still hurts",Favor
England were never gonna win that match tbh.,Neutral
Sepp was an absolute blight on all of football,Favor
"Yes, I always wanted England to lose, but this was so unfair .. I still feel bad years later",Favor
"Stop comparing this to Hurst's goal in 1966. In that case, the ball most likely did fall on the line and wasn't a goal. But it's impossible to say for certain with the footage we have. It was a tight call for the linesman. It is the kind of call they routinely made mistakes on in the days before slow mo replays. This just happened to be in such a high profile game. I wouldn't blame England or even the referees for this. There were also no Jumbotrons in the stadium in 1966 replaying it._x000D_

Unlike Hurst's goal, the debate over Lampard's goal was settled in less than a minute after just one replay. And the fact that there was no goal line technology even as late as 2010 when several other sports had video assisted technology is just ridiculous. So it was a true injustice.",Favor
the biggest robbery in all of history,Favor
"Anyway, you search it ""Lampard goal Vs Germany""",Favor
I remember watching this aged 6 and it put me off football for years because I thought football was an unfair sport if they were gonna disallow a ball that clearly went into the net. It wasn't until 2016 I watched another game of football.,Favor
"We might have lost the battle, but we did win the war…",Favor
You've got to respect the professionalism of Lampard here - he looks shocked for a few seconds then gets on with the game. I'd have gone nuts.,Favor
We cheered like we scored a goal 😅,Favor
100% clear goal🇲🇾🇵🇸💥,Favor
"i believe if this goal was allowed England would have miraculously won the game, they would have had double the determination of that german side.",Favor

i remember the shitstorm that was caused by this,Favor
this will always count as a goal,Favor
What a mess,Favor
This is why VAR came in play,Favor
What of Ikpeba's penalty in Lagos against Cameroon in 2000?🙄🤔,Neutral
"It’s reasons like this why we need to bring back the death penalty…….

I’m joking obviously. I’ve been following football over 25 years and this is without doubt one of the worst if not the worst refereeing decisions I’ve ever seen. How the ref and linesmen both missed it when everyone else saw it is completely beyond me.",Favor
"Germany in World Cups is so much better than England, despite the decline since 2014.",Neutral

did the referee get sacked after this game,Favor
Thanks very much Sepp Blatter is my favourite commentary quote,Neutral
That would have changed the outcome of that game. Typical England getting some shit in every tournament.,Favor
Always against the Fucking Germans,Favor

"England would still lose the game by 4-2, even if it was a goal. That was clearly a goal.",Favor
"Now they're complaining about Japan's second goal vs Spain. Back when there was no VAR and goal line tech, clear goals such as this were disallowed.",Favor
"Now we have the Japan goal controversy against Spain and FIFA still won't release the pictures which would confirm whether the ball was out or not.

FIFA is still corrupt.",Favor
Hi for those who watches that one after out ball goal from Japan against Spain in the World Cup 2022 group stage which is because of that goal Germany were knocked out !!! 😂,Neutral

History moment 😢 big lampard,Favor
Definitely a goal,Favor

I hope he is here!!!! 
I bet his scurming at his seat",Favor
"The referee is legitimately retarded
It was in, it was so far in!",Favor
I have never forgiven Neuer for the way he acted. He was literally looking at the ball as it crossed the line and deliberately restarted play as fast as he could so the referee would have to rush his decision.,Favor
If only the ball bounced forward instead of back across the line.,Favor
"Fun fact: Neuer later admitted he knew it was a goal but played dumb for the referee to see, leading to one of his biggest controversies.",Favor
Thanks very much sepp blatter🖕,Favor

Fifa & UEFA have made it clear they hate the English. And there are many moments like this during the World Cup and Euros. One of the most obvious goals you will ever seen. Everyone knew it was in but I don’t think there is any other explanation the. The refs and linesman cheated our nation.,Favor

England had a chance to win the game with that goal allowed. Without it no chance,Favor
Germany call it wembely something because it happened once when they played together and Germany scored a clear over the line goal and it didn’t count,Favor
8 years after this match I still don't know why referee made this scandalous decision... Goal was surely!,Favor
"Had this goal been allowed, it would of been a completely different game. Massive morale boost going into half time, would have made the second half different as well. Not saying we would of won, Germany are and always have been a great team. But this goal deffo would have changed things.",Favor

Yes England were playing rubbish in that game against Germany but if that was given we would of came back from 2-0 down against the mighty Germans . Not bad for a team playing crap .,Favor
When john terry cleared a ball of the line that should have been a goal against us in 2012 Sep blatter then decided he wanted goal line technology. He just hated England and is just an all round cunt and con man.,Favor

No sportsmanship at all form neuer. Should have been banned,Favor
Referee is a fucking wanker dick head and blind mother fucker,Favor
The referee is a fucking wanker that was a clear goal,Favor
"It was a perfectly good goal but let's be realistic, Germany could've been at least 4 goals ahead by half-time. The scoreline of 2-1 flattered England a lot.

Yes, I know it should've been 2-2 but that's no excuse as to why England lost. England lost because they were a bunch of overpaid bigheads who did nothing other than completely mock the game.....and those performances followed on during Poland/Ukraine 2012, Brazil 2014 & France 2016. Germany played phenomenal attacking football throughout this tournament and had they not been so frightened of Spain in the semis, they could've won this tournament. They've been playing good football since the tournament they hosted in 2006. I know they won Brazil 2014 but they could (and should) have won at least another tournament for the last 10 years.

Anyway, England supposedly scored a ""goal"" in the 1966 Final when it was proven that the ball never actually crossed the line. You never heard the Germans using that as an excuse. They were gracious in defeat & accepted it. Need to stop giving excuses and accept that the England players are arrogant lowlife shits. Russia 2018 will be diabolical as well!",Against
Can't wait until Sepp Blatter and all the other old FIFA cunts die,Favor

"This is the sole reason as to why goal line  technology had to be used. If it were to be invented earlier, goals like that would have stood and we could have potentially went through to the semi finals.",Favor
"Still to this day it confuses me why goal line technology wasn't brought in until very recently, cases like this prove it should've been introduced far earlier.",Favor
German fan here. But that was one of the worst referee decison made in WC. Anyway the exact opposite did happened to west german side in 1966 final.,Favor
ref is a fucking wanker and needs his fucking eyes tested,Favor
england was shit defensively but played some great attacking football. the scpre of 4 1isnt the truth. if thisbgoal counts england is very much in thr game,Favor

What a fucking idiot that referee was. What the hell are those extra reffs doing,Favor
This scene led to the introduction of VAR.,Favor
Reason why var exists,Favor
VAR should've been invented when Diego Maradona did the Hand of God.,Favor

"What a shame, I always wanted England to lose but this was pathetic, so unfair that even I can't get over it since 2010",Favor
This is the main reason why the goal line technology was invented because of this disallowed goal,Favor
This pales in comparison to Frank Lampard's disallowed 2010 WC goal versus Germany. That was a robbery as England probably could've won that one. The hand of God happened in way back in 1986: talk about selective memory! Also England didn't have a chance that time.,Favor

It's not even debatable it was a goal clearly over the line you don't even need VAR to check it.,Favor
How the hell has the ref not given this so unfair I know they had no var but its clear as day bro,Favor
What's crazy is that in an adidas ad in 2006 they show an exact same thing happening where lampard shoots and khan claims its not a goal,Favor
This goal created VAR,Favor
if Lampard thought he saw it... then the Goalkeeper knew it. fantastic 'goal' 🤝,Favor
People with Commons sense would know when the ball hits the bar inwards its gonna bounce inside the line,Favor
I was so mad about this and I’m not even english.,Favor
England were awful but that decision was a crime against football,Favor
Neuer act like it wasn't a goal but he know it was a goal,Favor
And that kids was the birth of goal line technology,Favor
What if lampards goal counted against Germany in world cup?,Favor
It went in twice,Favor
"horrible horrible decision from the reff, anyone with a brain would see that CLEARLY go over the line",Favor
apparently the judge put the house on the Germans,Favor
Not sure if goaline technology or VAR would have happend if not for this match,Favor
This is a legendary moment in football that I still remember and probably is a key reason why VAR is used today,Favor
I'm from Scotland and this disallowed goal just really makes me horny.,Neutral
That is why its fair to have VAR,Favor
