Luis suarez cost Ghanaians the world cup semi final because he knew he was going to lose.Ghana could have even gone to the final and beat spain,Against
"I remember at school at the time, people was calling him everything under the sun. I understood that he did what he had to do. Growing is realising that any of us in that position in the world cup would have done the exact same thing",Neutral
This man clearly was often mentally unstable,Irrelevant
Stuff like that prove that morality always loses and nice guys always finish last,Against
Suarez speaking as if Uruguay won that world cup they didn't even get third place lol,Irrelevant
He will never step foot in Ghana,Irrelevant
By apolosing he would look stupid because players do worst than that I saw goalkeepers attack players and break there foot already to avoid them from scoring,Neutral
Like how is this NOT smart play? Players sometimes end up injuring players in the penalty area to defend a goal. This is why the penalty exists. A team can defend a goal however the hell they want to. It's your job to score the penalty. You missing a penalty means you suck,Favor
Hand of Satan :D,Favor
"The rules should get changed at that point even if it doesn’t happen often. If a ball gets stopped on the line illegally the goal should count.
In basketball it’s similar. If a player stops the ball going to the basket and already being in a downfall it counts as 2 or 3 points immediately.",Neutral
"Dont play football at all, but what he did was perfectly fine in my opinion, if there is no rule to punish this harder: Hate the game not the player",Favor

"At the same time I am proud of Suarez, but sad that its with Ghana. I would like it happend with some top team, for whom semi-finals would not be that big dream, but popular sad story they lost😅",Neutral
Ghana fans call the handball unsportsmanlike but when they see him crying when Uruguay gets knocked out they make fun of him. Stupid logic.,Against

I would have done the same lol,Neutral
Respect the handball as much as a last man tackle to save a goal. Ive seen plenty of goalies and defenders foul on purpose to save a goal and its no different that what Suarez did,Favor
He had no choice.   A chance vs losing the game.   It’s a no brainer.,Favor
It's a world cup I'd do the same,Favor

If it was Jorge Fucile that saved (the other defender on the line who also tried handballing it) most people probably wouldn't blame him it's just cuz people don't like suarez,Neutral

Unfortunately there was no rule for this. In such a case a referee should have just given 2 goals to Ghana instead of a penalty.,Neutral
This is one of the funniest moments of my lifetime,Irrelevant
The guy next to him had the same idea,Neutral
mane i think if we was in the world cup we would all do this for our country,Favor

What a joke as a player and a cheat,Against
"The true villain for ghana is their own player. Blame asamoah gyan for missed that penalty. He’s the one who eliminated ghana, not suarez",Against

Suarez did double safe. First one came from his legs and next from his hands.,Favor
"Shouldn’t have been a penalty. It should have been an automatic goal. If his hands weren’t there, it would have gone in, full stop. How is Suarez still allowed to play in FIFA games after so much controversy???",Against

Any team and any player in that critical situation would have done the same if in the same position. Not on Suarez but on Gyan for missing that penalty kick. Uruguay Para siempre 🇺🇾,Neutral
Ironically that ball was going straight at his head.. he could have just headed it,Neutral
He turned that goal chance from 100% to 50/50. Call it a cheat but I think any pro player would have done that to win the game on the biggest stage.,Favor
"Suárez is a clear example of what an athlete should NEVER be. In my opinion that should've counted as a Goal and not a penalti, after all it was going In. We need a change on the rules, so to prevent other players from doing the same",Against
"Why do people complain, it's still a part of the game. You commit that, your team gets a red card so you play as 10 and enemy team gets a free penalty. I don't find it as cheating at all, these are the rules, the referee gave the red and the penalty, so no reason to complain.",Neutral
"The free kick from Ghana was not real. Look it up on google images. Dude was at least 1 1/2 meters away from the Uruguay defense. FiFA wanted to Africa to pass to make it seem real

"There should be a rule where if a team stops the ball on the line with a hand, it is an automatic goal. A penalty is only 80% chance of a goal statistically. They already did enough to score and they are forced to do it again? Unfair, and shows that cheating works.",Against
"If I want to save my family from death by sacrificing myself, I will do that because I love my family. I don't get my point well, there's a problem for you. Literally, Luiz Suarez did that. Call him cheater or what, he did that to save his country from elimination.",Favor

With grando doing nothing in the post all season gremio should have brought this gem back,Irrelevant

Was the right thing to do honestly. I don't know why we don't we have more incidents like this. Use all means necessary to keep your team in the running. Punishment is penalty/ red card?  I'll take that deal.,Favor
