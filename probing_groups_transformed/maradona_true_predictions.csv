Yup. Goalies sucked these days,Favor
goal #3 was the hand of god as he referred it himself. (he was boxing the ball in),Against
"An incredible and unique talent my favourite goal is where he dribbles around the entire England team to score and I am English. But why include the hand of God goal where he cheated there is nothing special about that. When other teams try to kick Maradona out of the World Cup using physical intimidation, that was wrong, but equally using your hand to score, a goal is just as wrong.",Against

Im sorry but what are these goalkeepers doing,Favor
half of the goals would not happened with the quality of todays goal keepersbut then he would have found other ways to score. It wouldnt have been so easyFussball has so much evolved on so many levels but if you are exceptional you grow with the challenges and so Diego would have tooI remember his playing when I was glued to the TV back at World cup in 1982it was a pure magic and i was 8 yrs old,Favor

"His life, his addictions, the hand of god, the other goal, life is life, the banning, that mental celebration. The maradona keep ups (stand in the same spot and hit it up as hard as you can and keep doing it not taking any more than one or two steps) him winning the world cup and doing the offormentioned goals against the country his was at war with a few years earlier, him dragging napoli to a scudetto. You can argue you all you want about other players just based on ability but for pure madness, skill, scandal he's the greatest of all time for me and I'm English albeit not a very patriotic. The same reason why Cantona will always be my favourite United player its not just football its the arc. It's folklore, its a soap opera that you'll never tire of revisiting. When you're old, on your last days on earth and football fanatic you'll rewatch it I guarantee",Favor
