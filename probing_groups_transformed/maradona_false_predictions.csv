tbh most of them are Messi's ordinary goals,Against

The Marchant of drugs,Against

You cant Never compare this player to Messi,Against
"Just because Maradona did it easily, it is not right to say that Messi can do it too.",Against
The WORST cheat in the history of world football.,Favor
It is very difficult to choose the greatest player of all time between Maradona and Messi. Though Messi scored some difficult goals but in sense of vision Maradona was phenomenal. The pitches of those time were so deadly and the defender could murder the soft players.,Favor
Didnt he make a 13m curved penalty kick once?I was a child and watched it live.. perhaps between 1985-90.,Neutral
"Pele was the best. Maradona, meh.",Against
Very few players shit all over Messi.,Against
Only maradona and ali karmi,Favor
Goal #3. Why would you include that?,Favor
The best goal is number 2,Against
A lot of them seem just luck.,No
The had some pretty resigned goalies back then.,Favor
This compilation is hardly the best...many of these goals are relatively ordinary,Against
"Unfortunately he got himself ruined by false friends, condolences",Against
How could you lay such unintelligent music on a video with such a fotball genius? A disgrace.,Irrelevant
Nowadays would not make that difference but his left foot was something different,Against
bye maradounut hahaha,Against
None of them are exciting except the number 1. All others are clear mistakes of goal keepers.,Favor
goal number 13 barcelona vs zvezda in Belgrade. Never before and never since zvezda fans applauded an opposing player when he scored a goal.,Neutral
Definitely not on messi or Ronaldos level not even Neymar,Against
Ronaldo 9 and Maradona are the best ever ever ever,Favor
We all knew what number 1 was gonna be,Favor
Hes a legend but the first 5 or 6 keeper are literally sleeping,Favor
"And don't forget he was even smaller/shorter than Messi 1'65 v 1'69cm. You have to be far more talented and superstrong just to make the ""A Team"" in any sport let alone be the world's No.1 for over a decade. Of course there's always the suspicion that the world's top sports pros and athletes use the best performance-enhancing concoctions they can get their hands on - some legal, some maybe not so much..Paul G",Against
"NOTHING, messi hasn't done, but I don't see maradona doing what messi does. Those are facts. Messi is the GOAT.",Against
Yall trippin Pele was the greatest ball player that ever lived,Against
Maradona was INFINITELY better 'n Messi.....,Favor
According to Maradona himself...his best goal was one he made when he played for Argentinos Juniors vs Deportivo Pereira in 1980. Similar to the WC of MEX 86...but this one was even crazier as for each player he dribbled (5)...was left on the ground...and they stayed there on the ground to watch the magic of D10Shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcAx2ZPYRFk,Neutral
He is better than pele and all other player,Favor
"yes wonderful, but they dont show the hundreds shot he missed...",Neutral
2 is hand of god,Favor
This did. less to highlight how brilliant Maradona was and more to highlight how piss poor the defending and goalkeeping was. My God thats Sunday league shit,Favor
I gotta be honest look at how poor the defending and keeping is tho,Irrelevant
When I see this I respect Messi more... The GOAT always gives his team mates a chance to score rather than by himself..,Favor
Great player I think u missed Napoli Fiorentina goal where he dribbled even more players than in the goal against England,Favor
Maradona>>>>>>>peleBro really had that chip game,Favor
Maradona never form remember . ..we love Maradona.,Favor
The hand of god is not a gol,Favor
