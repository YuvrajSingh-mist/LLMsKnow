That fighting spirit and nasty edge got Suarez so far in his career. This is clearly not fair play, but the sacrifice he made was quite legendary.
The reason i looked up this video because i was just thinking about what made Van Bommel and Robben have that edge and it's a similar winner mentality and they would do whatever it takes to win.

### Input:
This happened to me when I played soccer for my school. The goalkeeper went down blocking a shot and the rebound landed straight at my feet. All I had to do was launch it over him and it was an instant goal. As the ball was sailing under the crossbar and we started to celebrate a defender came out of nowhere and blocked it just like a goalkeeper. We stood amazed and said, ""You can't do that!"" We converted the penalty. The scorer said to me after that the goal belonged to me, but we also talked how smart that defender was and how we should do the same thing in that situation.
