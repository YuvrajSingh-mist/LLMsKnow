### Input:
Well 1966 the goal was given because the assist referee was influenced by Hurst's reaction as he later admitted (it doesn't matter if the ball crossed the line or not), the swiss referee had not seen a goal and asked the assist.

Here is a similar situation, Neuer pretended that nothing happened and brought the ball very quick back into the game. The refs were influenced by this.

Reactions mattered in both games. The worst part is that in both cases the refs were absolutely useless. At least we have today technology and video proof to prevent situations like that as good as possible. But it boggles my mind that they still make mistakes despite having four referes on the field and 3 individuals that review the tv footage.

### Input:
Stop comparing this to Hurst's goal in 1966. In that case, the ball most likely did fall on the line and wasn't a goal. But it's impossible to say for certain with the footage we have. It was a tight call for the linesman. It is the kind of call they routinely made mistakes on in the days before slow mo replays. This just happened to be in such a high profile game. I wouldn't blame England or even the referees for this. There were also no Jumbotrons in the stadium in 1966 replaying it._x000D_

Unlike Hurst's goal, the debate over Lampard's goal was settled in less than a minute after just one replay. And the fact that there was no goal line technology even as late as 2010 when several other sports had video assisted technology is just ridiculous. So it was a true injustice.

### Input:
It was a perfectly good goal but let's be realistic, Germany could've been at least 4 goals ahead by half-time. The scoreline of 2-1 flattered England a lot.

Yes, I know it should've been 2-2 but that's no excuse as to why England lost. England lost because they were a bunch of overpaid bigheads who did nothing other than completely mock the game.....and those performances followed on during Poland/Ukraine 2012, Brazil 2014 & France 2016. Germany played phenomenal attacking football throughout this tournament and had they not been so frightened of Spain in the semis, they could've won this tournament. They've been playing good football since the tournament they hosted in 2006. I know they won Brazil 2014 but they could (and should) have won at least another tournament for the last 10 years.

Anyway, England supposedly scored a ""goal"" in the 1966 Final when it was proven that the ball never actually crossed the line. You never heard the Germans using that as an excuse. They were gracious in defeat & accepted it. Need to stop giving excuses and accept that the England players are arrogant lowlife shits. Russia 2018 will be diabolical as well!
