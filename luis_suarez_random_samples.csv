8653,"Forget about debates on Suarez for 1 sec and just conclude that Uruguay did not get a fully commendable win  then. 
Is it cheating?
No! It's by football rule a foul and the Ref did absolutely the right thing.  Red+Penalty. (Also, if you know what type of player Suarez is, it not too hard to conclude anyway)
Is it commendable?
Depending on your stands whether winning is everything or abiding by sportsmanship is more important. Anyone who plays football knows you COULD foul to delay or hold up attacks and depending  on the scoring chance the opponent have, your foul gets punishments. This is also why after this match many people suggest FIFA to add more severe punishment to fouls alike Suarez's but the problem being for a single player during a match, you cannot surpass a red card punishment, even against such a decisive and unprecedented foul.
About the what ifs
You just can't make what ifs in football matches. Sure, what if Ghana scored another goal before this? What if Suarez did not hand-ball? What if Gyan scored the Penalty? A single moment like this can just decide the matches outcomes and, like it or not, this is also what makes football so popular worldwide in the first place. Year later now we see football matches being fairer (VR video referees) and less referee mistakes (Lampard's denied goal and such alike)are made in general.
