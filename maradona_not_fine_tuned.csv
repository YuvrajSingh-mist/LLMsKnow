The music made me stop watching,Against
Yup. Goalies sucked these days,Against
goal #3 was the hand of god as he referred it himself. (he was boxing the ball in),Against
"Greatest player of all times, but this isn't a good video: some goals aren't among his most beautiful!",Against
tbh most of them are Messi's ordinary goals,Against
"An incredible and unique talent my favourite goal is where he dribbles around the entire England team to score and I am English. But why include the hand of God goal where he cheated there is nothing special about that. When other teams try to kick Maradona out of the World Cup using physical intimidation, that was wrong, but equally using your hand to score, a goal is just as wrong.",Against
He accomplished all that while wearing nut hugger shorts.,Neutral
The Real OG of all times,Favor
Women will never give birth to a football player like him.,Against
The goalkeepers look very bad in most of these...,Against
"I still think Messi is the better player, but there would be no Messi without Maradona. Imagine a team with those two. Would make the whole defense look like children.",Favor
Diego Maradonna ....the best to ever play. Ive never seen anyother player do the amazing things he did on the pitch.,Favor
"Watching Maradona is a Joy, forever.",Favor
Techno belongs at dance clubs and raves not in highlights videos,Against
"He was a goal thief, his goals weren't power shots it seems, he was an expert at those little lob over the head gentle goals, number 3 goal here was a hand ball only.....great little passer and dribbler though for sure.",Neutral
"People talk about Pele, cr7 , Messi but none were fighters. This guy was born for this game. Never cried for fouls, he gets up and run towards goal. Sheer passionate player who made team sport look like individual sport. Pure legend and no one come close to him. He just fight for ball all 90 minutes",Favor
Im sorry but what are these goalkeepers doing,Neutral
The Marchant of drugs,Against
half of the goals would not happened with the quality of todays goal keepersbut then he would have found other ways to score. It wouldnt have been so easyFussball has so much evolved on so many levels but if you are exceptional you grow with the challenges and so Diego would have tooI remember his playing when I was glued to the TV back at World cup in 1982it was a pure magic and i was 8 yrs old,Favor
Maradona was so cold. The keeper didn't stand a chance on most of these.,Against

When the football was football,Neutral
"My dad loved him, and i also love hime, he's the most brilliant player in my house as a 21 year old, and started football 18 years ago",Favor
"What about the goal he scored from mid circle for Sevilla? I cant find it on YouTube. He gave up the ball, bounced it once and took a shoot which only he had the guts to try score from that distance.",Favor
Just watching his pre-Game warm up was entertaining. A brillant footballer. Best of them all.,Favor

He was our hero in Scotland. And still is.,Favor

CAMEL and MARLBORO were sponsors for football???,Against
Goalkeepers are only there for decoration,Against
Back in the day nobody could play football that why he appeared to be that good,Against

The 3rd best player in the world,Against
What the hell were some of the goalies and defenders doing? . And #2 hand of god is wild,Against
CR nd LM behind DM surely,Against
Okay but defenders were so much worse back then... most of those goals would never happen in today's football,Against
Are you sure #7 is Maradona. Looks like Romario to me,Against
No one like Mardona,Against

Most of them are keeper s fault. Nothing special,Neutral
Messi is the greatest,Favor
The best football player I loved in my childhood,Against
I was born in 1977 and I saw what Dieguito did in 1986 in Fifa Cup! It was magic! He gained that tournement alone! He was The King of Mxico! Only Pel was better but I didn't in 1970!

"Maradone played in the era when ball are more heavy (fifa change standard of weight only after he retired), at that time the defender was ""killer"", if Maradona play in our era with the last ball and referee protection he can finish every season with 60 goals.

Interestingly every goal was off his left foot. Surprised its seems he cant bat from both sides of the plate so to speak.,Against
"An absolute genius with a football. The skill, the swagger, the sheer audacity in which he scored some of the best goals the world has ever seen. I remember that day in '86, watching that game, that last goal against England, for me, the finest goal of all time. RIP Diego.",Favor

Its almost like you guys have never seen Lawrence Shankland. He can kick with both feet.,Favor
Where did number 2 go?,Irrelevant
"His life, his addictions, the hand of god, the other goal, life is life, the banning, that mental celebration. The maradona keep ups (stand in the same spot and hit it up as hard as you can and keep doing it not taking any more than one or two steps) him winning the world cup and doing the offormentioned goals against the country his was at war with a few years earlier, him dragging napoli to a scudetto. You can argue you all you want about other players just based on ability but for pure madness, skill, scandal he's the greatest of all time for me and I'm English albeit not a very patriotic. The same reason why Cantona will always be my favourite United player its not just football its the arc. It's folklore, its a soap opera that you'll never tire of revisiting. When you're old, on your last days on earth and football fanatic you'll rewatch it I guarantee",Favor

Those long chips over the keeper from 25 yards away, running past 5 or 6 players with the ball never more than a couple of inches from his toes, his balance, his observation, his planning, his precision and his execution are just on a different level to anyone.

You can argue you all you want about other players just based on ability but for pure madness, skill, scandal he's the greatest of all time for me and I'm English albeit not a very patriotic. The same reason why Cantona will always be my favourite United player its not just football its the arc. It's folklore, its a soap opera that you'll never tire of revisiting.

Those long chips over the keeper from 25 yards away, running past 5 or 6 players with the ball never more than a couple of inches from his toes, his balance, his observation, his planning, his precision and his execution are just on a different level to anyone. I remember Archie Gemmill scoring against the Dutch for us in 1978 and how amazing and mind-blowing that was but the chances of seeing him do that again were slim but for Maradona that was the norm.

I know i will get hate messages, but i don t care. when u watch Messi goals, he was 5 times better than Maradonna. And also goals of Benzema, Suarez, Lewandowski, etc are better than the goals here.",Against
"Great vid, as much as I dont glorify his many personal habits that left much to be desired, what a striker. The epitome of centre forward play. Having you own awareness of your skill on the field is the start. But when you know what your opponents are thinking it puts you a step ahead. Only Zidane matched Maradonna for this kind of thinking game. My two fave players..ZZ added an edge over Diego here IMO with his physical stature and versatility in stemming counter attacks..",Favor

The 3rd goal on that list destroys any greatness that Maradona had. He scored that with his hand against Shilton and should have owned up like a real man. 100% cheat. Goes against what sportsmanship is all about.,Against
