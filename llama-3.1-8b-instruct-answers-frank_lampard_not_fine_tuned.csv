As an 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 fan, I can't explain how unlucky, if not cursed we are in tournament football! I've seen England get knocked out on penalties 7 times, seen key players like Owen, Rooney & Beckham hobble off in a couple of those very games, the latter even breaking their metatarsals on the verge of the tournament, seen Ronaldinho's freak goal make the difference, & even Kane missing a key penalty in the game against France in just the previous WC QF in Qatar. This Lampard goal is just another chapter in a truly heartbreaking history of following England! I pray i get to see lady luck finally favor England in my lifetime!!!

So... soccer refs blew a call... imagine that.

How about they get more than one blind idiot on the field at the same time... how STUPID are they that they only have one ref for the game with the biggest playing surface and some of the most fit athletes in the world?

Thinking that one guy is going to make all the right calls on-the-field is absurd, as is evidenced by the disgusting amount of faked injuries that get called as fouls.

### Input:
There's no way you can say this wouldn't have changed the game.

We went in 2-1 down, desperately needing a goal and massively disheartened. Both their goals in the 2nd half were goals on the break, largely caused by the fact we had to throw men forward. When the break for their 3rd goal began, we only had 1 defender outside of the attacking third.

If that had been scored, we'd have gone in 2-2. Level, just needing to hold our own, with the momentum and feeling confident. There's just no way you can pretend we'd be playing with 9 men in the final third in that situation.

Saying they won anyway is hugely misleading and completely misrepresentative. The game WOULD have panned out differently, and there's no way to say what would have happened.

The typical arrogance. To think that a goal that wasn't given in the first half of a round of 16 match that ended 4-1 was the most shocking moment. Are you joking?
